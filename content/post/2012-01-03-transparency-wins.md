[UC Berkeley just did a great assessment of Office 365 vs. Google Apps](http://bconnected-project.berkeley.edu/about/email-calendar-platform-comparison).  What I really like is how they were able to make the results easy to understand for their constituency.

I often struggle to communicate large, impactful descisions across a large organization.  They did a great job with the "Assessment Matrix" matrix they created that clearly spells out each function by priority, and which platform "wins".

In this case I think transparency wins.  Good example to learn from!
