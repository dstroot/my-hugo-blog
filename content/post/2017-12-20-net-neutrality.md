The internet is one of humanities greatest accomplishments and resources. It blankets our planet and provides us with:

* **Connectivity, communication, and sharing** - access to every human being also connected to it; billions of other people. People can communicate and collaborate across space and time - across the entire world.
* **Information, knowledge, and learning** - some believe effectively all the human knowledge that exists. You literally have access to billions of pages of information.
* **Entertainment** - Essentially an unlimited supply of games, plays, shows, movies, books, magazines, etc.
* **Digital economy** - it enables new business models and makes older business models more efficient. Here are a few examples:
  * **Internet of Things**
  * **Cloud Computing**
  * **Search**
  * **Social Media**
  * **Global Workforce**

### Internet Access Should be Encouraged by Government

Some people believe that Internet Access should be a legal right. The British government has said that it will guarantee a legal right to high-speed internet for all homes and businesses in the U.K. by 2020 under the Digital Economy Act of 2017.

Regardless of your belief in the Internet as a legal right, we should all be able to agree that access to the Internet promotes the digital economy and improves the lives of citizens.

### Why Regulation is Needed

Access to the Internet is provided by (or controlled) by Internet Service Providers (ISPs). One must pass "through" an ISP to reach the Internet.

Imagine a bridge that leads to the Library of Congress. The only way to enter the library is to pass over the bridge. The bridge owner could allow all to pass freely. Or, the bridge owner could:

* Only allow people who drive Ford cars to pass.
* Ask for your personal information and then sell that data to others who want to advertise to people who visit the Library of Congress.
* Force you to show what books you have checked out, and stop you from passing if you check out certain books.
* Insert advertising into your books.
* Decide people of your color or religion are not allowed to pass. 

Regulation is needed to

* **Protect Your Privacy**
* **Provide Information Security**
* **Promote access to all citizens**
