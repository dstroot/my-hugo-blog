![The polygon of enterprise despair](/img/polygon.png)

When enterprises see the destruction wrought by disruptors on incumbents in music (Spotify), media (Google) or retail (Amazon), they wonder what may be in store for them in the future. A Sloan Management Review survey found that 90% of executives anticipate their industry will be digitally disrupted to either a great or moderate extent. In the same study, only 44% of executives thought their company was adequately prepared.

Boards are right to be concerned, and settling for panaceas like innovation studios and occassional hackathons won’t be enough to secure a company’s digital future. There is a huge gulf between the speed and agility of a digital start-up and a large, entrenched incumbent - it's called the **Polygon of Enterprise Despair.**

<!--more-->

Some of you may have heard of [Paul Shetler](https://www.paulshetler.com/). Paul was the CEO of the Digital Transformation Office and the Chief Digital Officer of the Australian Government's Digital Transformation Agency. I believe Paul coined the term "Square of Enterprise Despair". I have taken some liberties with Paul's ideas and extended them to the "Polygon of Enterprise Despair". It certainly doesn't have the same ring to it, but it is a more complete picture to the challenges of working within a large enterprise.

Most importantly, tackling the Polygon of Enterprise Despair means reversing the deskilling and learnt helplessness of the organization on which it feeds. The reason why so many firms rely on contractors and heavy governance is ultimately because they don’t trust their employees to deliver anymore. In too many companies, that’s for good reason: a BCG report found digital capability and training is lacking, across industries like retail, financial services and consumer goods.

Let's run through each of the facets on the polygon of enterprise despair:

### 1. Institutional Inertia

Large incumbent enterprises exist because they **did things right**. They made good choices, hired good people and created good products and services. If they hadn't they would not be around today. The fact they were successful under the old paradigms is what makes it so hard to adapt to new ones.

Enterprises are realizing they are now becoming software companies, and the people running a software company need to know how to do that. There needs to be digital training at every level of the organization, including in the boardroom and executive suite.

Transformation by consensus, or by occasional hackathon, will not work, because transformation is not iteration from a low baseline: it requires making fundamental changes to an organization’s structure and processes.

‘Waiting any longer to embrace digital change means exposing your organization - and its employees - to the risk of being driven out of the market.’
Transformation is difficult and it’s essential, if businesses want to remain off a Receiver’s watch list in a digital world.

Organizations that want to thrive in the digital age need to redesign their internal structure, tackle the Square of Despair, upskill their staff and have the political will to radically transform themselves, rather than adopting tokenistic solutions.

Business as usual is no longer an option.

### 2. Cost Allocation

Poor cost allocation models create all manner of suboptimal enterprise behavior. Mainly they create a sense of helplessness for the department receiving the allocation. They feel they are unable to manage the allocation amount or service level. Maybe they would like a lower (or higher) service level and are will to sacrifice (or pay) for the privilege. But the enterprise usually only offers limited options, usually "one price, one service level".

Worse, the models that build up the costs to be allocated are usually only known inside the allocating organization and rarely reflect reality. If the organization receiving the allocation wants to "pull out" and buy the service from a third party they are usually told they can't because that would simply drive up costs for the remaining parties (same pie, bigger slices). So they feel stuck.

They conclude that if they can't change the allocation they can make damn sure to get the best possible service level. So they begin to beat on the organization supplying the service for higher service levels. This of course eventually ruins the working relationship between them and continues until all parties thoroughly dislike each other. It goes without saying that things do not move quickly or efficiently at this point because the parties stop speaking to each other, and in really bad cases they actively sabotage each other.

### 3. Risk Management

Enterprises have well developed risk management muscles. Particularly in regulated industries like healthcare or financial services. Since IT is the basis for nearly all business processes within a financial services company, the Risk Management function is always very interested in the consequences of a significant IT failure/outage, or a data breach.

They are so interested that they are very involved in key functions like project delivery and change management. The effect of this involvement is lots of documentation and meetings, two things that are sure to slow anything in an enterprise to a crawl.

Like some aspects of security, some the risk management is referred to internally as "risk management theatre". It exists to show we have it, and it's primary purpose is management reporting, however it typically fails to avert much risk. It is usually focused on issues that either occur regularly, or at least have already occurred in the past. It rarely anticipates issues that have never happened before, but of course those are the ones that can actually take down the company. The financial crises of 2009 is a great illustration. Does anyone think Bear Stearns or Lehman didn't have a risk management function? Of course they did - they just didn't anticipate the actual risk facing the firms.

Another example is a firm I know that created a "fund of funds", containing curated hedge funds. It sold daily liquidity, but the hedge funds only allowed monthly or quarterly liquidity. This worked quite well as money flowed in. It was of course a disaster during the crash. Risk Management never even looked at it ahead of time. But they know they can make departments like IT fill out loads of forms and this can be used to create wonderful reports.

### 4. Capability

An organization is only as good as it's people. Successful organizations start out with great people. Great people help build the company and many careers are built as the company matures.

#### Hiring Practices

#### Compensation Practices

As a company matures and it's industry grows benchmarking becomes increasingly important to the management team. This is especially pervasive inside HR organizations in enterprises who must

Usain Bolt doesn't look behind him, he only looks at the clock because he isn't racing the other runners, he is racing only himself. It is the other runners who measure themselves against him. In the same way compensation benchmarking is always behind. All benchmarking is an imperfect science but compensation figures are collected annually by large HR consulting firms and then sold in the next budget/compensation cycle. This means it is already stale when you get it.

Enterprises all say they want the best people, yet they attempt to benchmark their compensation to the average of year-old stale data. The A players get offered jobs elsewhere and leave, and the enterprise is left with average players at average compensation.

### 5. Security

If you’re working on something significant in a large enterprise, such as a new product, or installing new software, then it may become necessary to get a ‘security sign-off’.

Processes around this vary, but essentially, one or more security experts descend at some point on your project and audit it. It’s like a medieval trial by ordeal. You get poked and prodded in various ways while questions are asked to determine weaknesses in your story. This might involve a penetration test, a look at your code and documentation, or an interview with the engineers. There will likely be references to various 'security standards' which in turn are enforced with differing degrees of severity.

The beatings will continue until risks are identified (I’ve never heard of there being none). The outcome is a report outlining the set of risks that have been identified. These risks may need to be ‘signed off’ by someone senior so that responsibility lies with them if there is a breach. That process in itself is arduous (especially when the senior management person doesn’t fully understand the risk) and will be repeated on a regular basis until the risks are sufficiently ‘mitigated’ through further engineering effort or process controls.

After which it’s then re-reviewed.

### 6. Outdated Paradigms

What’s your oldest Excel spreadsheet still in use? This question was asked recently in an online discussion group. A lively conversation ensued where people tried to outdo each other.

> "I just realized that a spreadsheet I use weekly was first created in 2004 and has been in constant use now for over 13 years!"

The winner (or loser depending on your perspective) - several people who were still using spreadsheets created in 1995, the year that Excel began to take root with the launch of Microsoft Office for Windows 95. Hopefully they are no longer using Excel 95 and are presumably using a modern version of Excel. Yet these files — and the 'business logic' they contain — are still working for them now, some twenty-three years later.

> “You take the new thing and shove it into the old paradigm”.

It’s my strong opinion, backed by dozens of interviews, that companies embarking on a digital transformation are trying to apply company level strategies to a product level problem. As my friends over at Radical Product have eloquently said about this situation, “These are completely different classes of problem. It makes perfect sense that the same framework would not apply to both”.

### 7. Regulation

Regulators have power ultimately derived from government. They are able to enforce fines, penalties, and changes to business structure or processes. So they have the force of law as far as the enterprise is concerned. Global enterprises fall under the regulatory regimes of many different governments. It quickly becomes a nearly impossible task to track global regulatory compliance.

So to ‘simplify’ things large enterprises often create a set of rules that cover all the regulations that may ever apply to their business across all jurisdictions. Those rules are generally the strictest you can imagine. Added to that, those rules are curated by the legal/compliance organization and develop a life and culture of their own within the organization **independent of the regulator** - such that they can’t easily be brought into question.

These rules become huge inhibitors of change. Regulators embrace paradigms are rooted in the experiences of software built in previous decades - because that is what worked back then. And if you want to change that, it will itself likely take years and agreement from multiple parties who are unlikely to want to risk losing their job. So you can end up in a situation where you are forced to work in a way prescribed years ago by your internal legal and compliance team, which are in turn based on interpretations of regulations which were written years before. All based on software development processes that were created years before that!

Obviously, this slows things down further and makes change quite difficult. Want to bring development and operations closer together and form a "devops" team? Well that's not how we did it 25 years ago!

### 8. Procurement

As an enterprise grows it suddenly wakes up one day and realizes there are 50 departments/divisions/subsidiaries all buying "widgets" and if it could just coordinate and consolidate all "widget spend" it would save money. The logical thing to do is to create a centralized purchasing function to acquire widgets at the lowest possible price.

There are many ways in which this perfectly sensible idea goes very wrong. The very first of which is that the new head of widget procurement and the widget procurement officers and analysts all must justify their roles. It wouldn't make sense spending $1M annually to operate our widget procurement office while only saving $500k on widgets, would it?

The logical responses are:

1.  **Attempt to get more savings.** Let's squeeze the widget providers harder, cut down the number of widget providers so we have more leverage, commit to certain levels of widget spend, etc. If all goes well we will save even more money! However, the widget procurement process is now slower and less responsive to business needs. We may be saving on widgets but it may take months longer to buy widgets due to extensive negotiations. We now may be committed to buy a certain number of widgets - and if our needs change those savings may evaporate. We usually alienate our suppliers through this process so they have very little incentives to go "above and beyond" when called for. Finally, vendor consolidation may leave us more vulnerable to vendor risk. The fact our risk went up, our vendors don't like us anymore, and our agility went down, are very real costs, but unfortunately they are hard to quantify.
2.  **Put the savings in a better light.** Don't underestimate the lengths people will go to justify their position. I have seen savings estimated off the "highest widget price" vs. the "average widget price". Or, based on what widget prices are expected to be in the future. Or, based on some external benchmark like "industry average widget price". Anything that can be used to make our savings figures look as good as possible. Is this cynical? Yes. Does it really happen? Yes.
3.  **Cast a wider net.** Are we not saving enough on widgets to justify a department of widget procurement? Easy - what other things do we buy that the procurement office can help with? This is where technology always comes into focus. Technology is a large spend in any enterprise and that makes it an attractive target. However, buying technology is **not the same as buying widgets.**

First of all, technologists who are making big platform technology acquisition decisions have to look years into the future. Whatever decisions taken today will affect an enterprise for a long time. We have to meet with the vendors and understand their roadmaps. We must evaluate their underlying architecture. We must understand the ecosystem they operate in. This knowledge comes by building relationships with Value Added Resellers (VARs) and the vendors themselves.

Once we make a purchasing decision we expect the VAR, or occasionally the vendor, to help us with bringing the new technology online. We expect security advice, configuration support and advice, and deployment help. These services may not be explicitly called out, or priced in a bid, but they are very important and valuable. Success or failure may hinge on these services.

What happens when procurement gets involved? First, they make sure that technical people have no direct control over the negotiation (or sourcing process) at all. Second the relationships that technology has nurtured over time migrate to procurement, disconnecting the technology practitioners, and making it difficult for them to get the information they need to be effective going forward.

What often happens is something close to this:

- You go to senior person to get sign-off for a budget for purpose X
- They agree
- You document at least two options for products that fulfill that purpose
- The sourcing team will take that document and negotiate with the suppliers
- Some magic happens
- You get told which supplier "won"

This process helps reduce the risk that someone has undue influence to push a particular vendor (there are strict rules around accepting so much as a coffee from a potential supplier), which is a good thing. On the other hand, this process can take months (or even years). And might need to be repeated if the process takes so long that funding has disappeared or teams have been disbanded.

To complicate matters further, sourcing might have its own preferred supplier lists of companies that have been vetted and audited in the past. If your preferred supplier isn't on that list (and hasn't made a deal with one on those list), the process could take longer or stall.

To add insult to injury those "valued added" services your VARs used to provide are no longer provided because they were either squeezed out in the negotiations, or you have lost the relationship capital you formerly had.

The enterprise "saves money" by trading for the costs of delay, lack of agility, and treating supplies as adversaries instead of partners.

### 9. Legacy

All large enterprises have a base of legacy applications and code; plus legacy people, with legacy skills to care for them. New, younger employees view working on this stuff like career suicide and run as far away as possible. Unfortunately legacy applications are always at the heart of the enterprise's most basic business processes - after all they were so important they were the first automation projects in historical times.

More automation grew around them and integrated with those systems, taking into account their data structures and quirks. Then even more automation was layered on top of that, and later we added data warehouses, analytics and bolted on web architecture. Replacing legacy systems is like open heart surgery on an elderly patient - wonderful news when it works, but funeral arrangements must be made if it doesn't.

> "If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"

It becomes nearly impossible to gain sponsorship to replace legacy systems because of the inherent costs and risks. What executive wants to sponsor a legacy system replacement when they can instead champion a new predictive analytics system or a spiffier web site? So these systems lumber on like large ancient beasts, cared for and fed by a tribe that speaks "assembly", "VSAM", "JCL" and "COBOL" and communes with companies like IBM that were dominant when "I Dream of Jeanie" was on TV. Of course there is no current documentation of how the system works or what the system does - it exists only in the heads of the tribe members.

CIO's talk about reducing "run" costs to free up resources for "change". Legacy systems usually have many years of intricate patching and modifications making them very brittle and difficult to change. Older hardware and software may require added compatibility layers to facilitate integration with "modern" hardware and software. All of this drives up the run costs. The key issue is how do you materially change your run costs without ever having the sponsorship, resources and political will to tackle the legacy systems? I suppose it's for the same reason that some of us smoke and are overweight; we know it's bad for us but somehow the will to change evades us.

The net effect is, like an athlete, the enterprise can run only as fast as it heart can beat and it's lungs can breathe. Legacy systems are not "real-time", but rather "batch", so the heart only beats once a day (or maybe several times per day). The large enterprise with legacy systems and sofware at its heart cannot keep up with younger, fitter rivals.

### 10. Change Control

In an enterprise, especially in a regulated industry, there is always some kind of system that tracks and audits changes to ensure that changes don’t happen without due oversight. This is because auditors **love this kind of stuff**. To ensure "audit-ability" of changes there is a process:

- Changes must be raised to the "change control board", which normally requires filling out an onerous form.
- Then the form must be approved/signed off by anyone responsible for any area that may be impacted. So let's say we are making a network change. Since every service runs on top of the network, every person responsible for every service will have to sign off. In theory, the person signing off must carefully examine the change to ensure it is sensible and valid. In reality, most of the time trust relationships build up between change raiser and change validator which can speed things up.
- There might also exist ‘standard changes’ or ‘templated changes’, which codify more routine and lower-risk updates and are pre-authorised. These must also be signed off before being deployed (usually at a higher level of responsibility, making it harder to achieve).
- Then the compliance, risk and security officers have to weigh in and approve the change.
- The the approved change will be reviewed and ratified by the change control board and only then can the change be implemented.
- Changes are scheduled into predetermined change windows, but only so many changes can fit into any one window, and common wisdom is to not make too many changes at once, so some changes will be pushed to the next available window.
- While in theory the change can be signed off in minutes, in reality change requests can take weeks or months as obscure fields in forms are filled out wrongly (‘you put the wrong code in field 44B!’), sign-off deadlines expire, change freezes come and go, and so on.
- As a result there is sometimes the concept of an "emergency" change request that very senior people can approve and basically "push it through". However, very senior people don't like approving emergency changes and ask lots of uncomfortable questions.

All this makes the effort of making changes far more onerous than it is elsewhere.
