When I was growing up, when you read the paper, watched the news, saw a film or a picture, you inherently believed in it.  You trusted the reality it portrayed.  If you heard someone say “Kennedy’s death was faked” you would likely not believe them because you saw the evidence yourself.  

We all learned the hard way that we can’t trust the Internet. We no longer know what is real and what is fake.  With everything now digital, and with excellent tools to edit audio, video, and photos, we are now non-believers. As soon as we see a viral video on YouTube we immediately say to ourselves “that’s fake”. Every magazine with a beautiful girl on the cover we think to ourselves “Photoshop”. When we read a blog post we think “spin”.

We no longer trust the news or what we read or see on the Internet. We live in strange and interesting times because now people are now free to believe whatever they want to believe.
