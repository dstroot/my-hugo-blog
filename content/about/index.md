# About Me

However you know me, or however you found me, I’m glad you are here.

I have been a Chief Information Officer for a long time and it's clear that “managing information” is just the price of entry. In today's world I think CIO must mean “Chief Innovation Officer”. Managing innovation buys you a seat at the head table.

My ambition is to find ways in which technology and innovation can be leveraged for more effective, more engaging, more sustainable, and more exciting business growth.

Some examples I am interested are:

*   Harnessing the consumerization of enterprise technology
*   Encouraging data “curation” and ownership in a large, diverse corporate enterprise
*   The social enterprise, ideas and how they propagate and mass collaboration
*   Social brand development, social capital and online reputation
*   Frictionless security - i.e. security that will not be actively resisted by employees
*   Development approaches that are rapid, iterative & nimble
*   Open source, transparent, collaborative, “hive” development
*   Scale computing in all forms, shapes and sizes (Cloud, Software as a Service, Platform as a service, etc.)

## A Little More on Me - the Personal Side

I’ve been happily married to Julie for over twenty-two years, and have I have two children, Matt and Elise, who make me very proud. Julie and I met at UCLA where she was in Pi Beta Phi and I was in Lambda Chi Alpha. Go Bruins!

My favorites movies are Princess Bride and Dead Poets Society. I actually have "Carpe Diem" imprinted on my custom iPad cover!

I love driving/riding anything with a motor and enjoy both dirt and street motorcycing and yes I probably go too fast. I generally love anything outdoors. Seems I have really gotten into hiking lately. I appreciate a good 10-15 mile summit hike and have hit most of the local southern California peaks. It's good to get your heart rate up for 4-8 hours!

My favorite place on earth is Hawaii, so a big mahalo to all of you who feel the same way. There is no place else where I can literally step off the plane and feel the weight lift from my shoulders and my spirit open up.

## Technical Details About This Site

We are all standing on the back of giants and I am constantly amazed at the quality and diversity of tools available. I love learning and using new technology, and I am a generally curious person, so I am always interested in what technologies others use to create sites - so I thought I might share what tools I am using.

While this site is very simple in some ways in others it serves as my classroom and testbed. It is basically a static site built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on Amazon [S3/CloudFront](http://aws.amazon.com/). Since I am using the Cloudfront CDN I have good delivery performance globally.

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through Markdown and Liquid converters, and creates a complete, ready-to-publish static website. This simplicity keeps it very reliable and also very secure. This is a great lesson for corporate sites - the simpler the architecture the easier it is to secure and operate.

Here is a quick list of what I am currrently using:

*   Source code and content is managed on [GitHub](https://github.com/)
*   Continuous integration testing is performed by [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/)
*   Site is published via [S3_website](https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website)
*   Dependencies are watched by [David](https://david-dm.org)
*   Site performance and uptime is monitored using Rew Relic/Pingdom as well as AWS tools
*   Site analytics are provided by [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/)
*   My personal images are served from [Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/)
*   Blog images are served directly from [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com)
*   The UI framework is [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
*   The build system is [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
*   The CSS is compiled from [LESS](http://lesscss.org/)
*   Site comments are provided by [Disqus](http://disqus.com/)
*   Site mailing list is managed via [Mailchimp](http://mailchimp.com/)
