			 	<h1>Why is Apple&#39;s Capital Expenditure up 57% for 2014?</h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Wed, Oct 30, 2013</span>
			      <p><img class="lazy img-rounded img-responsive" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" alt="Apple's Campus" data-src="/assets/img/iSpaceship.jpg" width="750"></p>

<p>Apple’s most recent 10-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission shows the company has budgeted <strong>$11 billion in capital expenditures for fiscal 2014</strong>.</p>

<p>This is more than <strong>5 times</strong> Apple&rsquo;s capital expenditure in 2010 and <strong>57 percent more than the $7 billion it spent in 2013</strong>.</p>

<p>What is Apple planning to do with all that additional money?</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2013/10/30/how-many-ios-devices-will-be-produced-in-the-next-12-months/">Horace Dediu</a> perhaps Apple is just conducting business as usual and the increased CAPEX simply reflects potentially higher sales volumes for iOS devices in 2014.  He has a chart that tracks capital expenditure against iOS device volume and they track very closely.  But I think the relationship may be somewhat coincidental.</p>

<p>Consider Apple&rsquo;s desire to move away from Samsung. Be it on displays or in chips, I suspect this strategic direction is increasing CAPEX significantly without any corresponding unit sale increases.</p>

<p>I also suspect the new campus has a significant impact. In addition we must consider the data centers Apple has been building over the last 2 years to support it&rsquo;s cloud services - clearly not production related CAPEX.</p>

<p>Logically a portion of 2014 CAPEX is going to new device development and production - the iPhone 6 will very likely have a new form-factor and design.  The iPod line needs a refesh.  But the iPad Mini and iPad Air in my opinion will remain as is in 2014.  So is the iPhone and iPod enough to drive CAPEX up that strongly?  I doubt it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-30/apple-s-capital-spending-to-rise-to-11-billion-for-fiscal-2014.html">Earlier this week, Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said the company is working on new releases in technology categories where it doesn’t yet compete.</a>  So perhaps an iWatch or an iTV is what is driving this spend.  But maybe there is something really revolutionary coming.  Personally I want to be surprised and amazed in 2014 - just like when the original iPhone was introduced back in 20007.</p>
