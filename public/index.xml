&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;lazy img-rounded img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=&#34; alt=&#34;FinTech&#34; data-src=&#34;/assets/img/volkswagen.jpg&#34; width=&#34;750&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point in time I worked for an organization that banned the use of open source software.  They were concerned that in the event of issues &amp;ldquo;there would be no support&amp;rdquo;.  At the time they believed that commercial software from companies like IBM, Oracle, Microsoft and SAP was &amp;ldquo;safer&amp;rdquo; because there was a commercial entity that stood behind the products they sold and provided support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;now-that-s-changing&#34;&gt;Now that&amp;rsquo;s changing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most technology leadership today recognizes that proprietary software is not safer than open source software. Basic metrics around the number of disclosed vulnerabilities and &amp;ldquo;time to patch availability&amp;rdquo; seem to give an edge to open source software at least being patched faster.  Not only that but you have the option to inspect the code yourself, and patch it yourself - options that are simply not available with commercial, closed software. This causes a re-evaluation of the relationship of proprietary, commercial software to operating a safe and secure business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent Volkswagen scandal brings to light the broader question of how vulnerable we are to software that is beyond oversight.  Today when we have software running critical systems like medical devices, transportation systems, elevators, and cars we are realizing this code &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be open to inspection. This does not mean the code must be open source - only that the code must be available for inspection and oversight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for evaluating the risks of new devices and monitoring the safety and efficacy of those currently on market. The software on these devices performs life-sustaining functions such as cardiac pacing and defibrillation, drug delivery, and insulin administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the agency is unlikely to scrutinize the software operating on devices during any phase of the regulatory process unless a model that has already been surgically implanted repeatedly malfunctions or is recalled. Despite the crucial importance of these devices medical device software is considered the exclusive property of its manufacturers, meaning neither patients nor their doctors are permitted to access their source code or test its security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;proprietary-software-puts-us-at-risk&#34;&gt;Proprietary software puts us at risk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Columbia University professor, Eben Moglen, who founded the Software Freedom Law Center, has argued proprietary, and thus invisible, software puts us all at risk. He uses the analogy of being able to inspect an elevator&amp;rsquo;s operating mechanical condition as a foundational principle for having &amp;ldquo;safe&amp;rdquo; elevators.  But isn&amp;rsquo;t the software that operates  elevators necessary to inspect as well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Proprietary software is an unsafe building material”&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;em&gt;- Eben Moglen, Law Professor, Columbia University&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we have &amp;ldquo;safe&amp;rdquo; cars or medical devices when the software is a black box and we simply have to trust the manufacturers? The code in automobiles is tightly protected under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Last year, several groups sought to have the code made available for “good-faith testing, identifying, disclosing and fixing of malfunctions, security flaws or vulnerabilities”. In response, a group of automobile manufacturers said that opening the code to scrutiny could create “serious threats to safety and security.” Think about that for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When proprietary code inflicts harm, such as Volkswagen’s polluting cars, the creators of that code must be held accountable. It’s definitely time to start demanding appropriate transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saw the new Microsoft Surface Studio this weekend at the Microsoft store at the South Coast Plaza. I thought the display is pretty mind blowing. I have gotten used to wide screen displays but somehow the resolution and format of the screen just feels right. The display floats in space and fills your field of vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The surface dial seems like it would be a gimmick but it isn&amp;rsquo;t. It feels very natural particularly when zooming in and out. Tilting the display down and working right on top of it is spectacular. Way to go Microsoft - you hit it out of the park!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Free to Believe Anything</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://danstroot.com/img/comic.png&#34; alt=&#34;Cognitive Bias&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was growing up, when you read the paper, watched the news, saw a film or a picture, you inherently believed in it.  You trusted the reality it portrayed. You trusted in journalism and even believed the news was actually &amp;ldquo;fair and balanced&amp;rdquo;. If you heard someone say “Kennedy’s death was faked” you would disbelieve them because you saw the evidence yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we all learned the hard way that we can’t trust the Internet. We no longer know what is real and what is fake.  With everything now digital, and with excellent tools to edit audio, video, and photos, we have become skeptics. As soon as we see a viral video on YouTube we immediately say to ourselves “that’s probably fake”. Every magazine with a beautiful girl on the cover we think to ourselves “Photoshop”. When we read a blog post we think “spin”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We no longer trust the news or what we read on the Internet. We live in strange and interesting times because now people are free to believe whatever they want to believe by discounting anything they see that does not align with their beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the big internet platforms, through their algorithms, have become an eye of a needle which news and media must pass through, limiting the content a person sees to that which already conforms to their views. The Internet is becoming one big &amp;ldquo;echo chamber&amp;rdquo; which is designed to filter and shape the information someone sees based on previous searches, as well as information it might have about their location or preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“More likely than not, you get your news from Facebook, forty-four per cent of US adults get news on the site, and 61% of millennials … if that doesn’t frighten you, you don’t know enough about Facebook’s algorithm. If you have a parent who’s a Trump supporter, they are seeing a completely different set of news items than you are.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - Caleb Gardner, President Barack Obama’s former social media adviser&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angela Merkel has joined a growing number of critics who have highlighted the dangers of receiving information that confirms an existing opinion or is recommended by people with similar ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Algorithms, when they are not transparent, can lead to a distortion of our perception, they can shrink our expanse of information.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merkel called the issue a “challenge not just for political parties but for society as a whole”. “Repeat a lie often enough and it becomes the truth”, is a law of propaganda often attributed to the Nazi Joseph Goebbels. Among psychologists this is known as the &amp;ldquo;illusion of truth&amp;rdquo; effect. Because we need to make quick judgements, we adopt mental shortcuts – heuristics. Relying on how often you&amp;rsquo;ve heard something to judge how truthful something feels is a strategy we all use. If we are only shown the news and information we choose to see, we are all reinforcing our cognitive biases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are the UK&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Brexit&amp;rdquo; movement and the USA&amp;rsquo;s Donald Trump just the beginning? Is our increasingly polarized country due going to get even worse because we are only fed the information we want to see, and conflicting information is filtered from view?  Isn&amp;rsquo;t a a healthy democracy dependent on people being confronted by opposing ideas?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is it Secure?</title>
      <link>http://danstroot.com/2015/09/26/is-it-secure</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;lazy img-rounded img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=&#34; alt=&#34;FinTech&#34; data-src=&#34;/assets/img/SmartCarLock.png&#34; width=&#34;750&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q&lt;/em&gt;: Is it secure? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;: No it is not. Security is never binary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q&lt;/em&gt;: OK, how secure is it? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;: It seems like you just asked that question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q&lt;/em&gt;: No, the first question was if it&amp;rsquo;s secure, the second question was how secure is it. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;: Well now that wasn&amp;rsquo;t even a question at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;there-is-no-such-thing-as-perfect-security&#34;&gt;There is no such thing as perfect security&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most information security practitioners do a poor job explaining the relative nature of security.  Secure relative to what? A bot that looks for un-patched systems? A determined hacker? A nation-state?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security is a &amp;ldquo;scale of difficulty&amp;rdquo; – like mountain climbing. Everest was thought to be unclimbable until Sir Edmund Hillary did it.  Everest was finally tackled by a massive expedition with enormous resources. The 1953 expedition totaled over 400 people, including 362 porters, 20 Sherpa guides and 10,000 lbs of baggage.  It was analogous to a military assault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given enough time and resources &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; security can be defeated.  The main goal of security is to raise the time and resources required to an unreasonable level.  But how do you really know how secure something is?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like mountain climbing, security can and should be rated/evaluated based on actual experience. Also like mountain climbing there are initial conditions that indicate a “tough climb” or an easy one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conditions-for-high-security-levels&#34;&gt;Conditions for high security levels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The technology is widely deployed/adopted.&lt;/strong&gt; Note that being widely deployed does NOT mean the technology is secure (Windows XP was widely deployed). It simply means that we are more likely to have lots of data about its security performance. The more opportunities and incentives for attack will give us more data, which increases our confidence of it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;rating&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The technology or system is attacked frequently with great intensity.&lt;/strong&gt; Ideally because of being widely deployed, it would be used is places that expose it to attack. Ideally those attacks are unrelenting.  This also increases our data about its security performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The technology is simple to install and configure.&lt;/strong&gt; Many supposedly &amp;ldquo;secure&amp;rdquo; systems are dependent on how they are installed, or post-install &amp;ldquo;hardening&amp;rdquo;.  Systems and technologies must be &amp;ldquo;secure by default&amp;rdquo; when installed and easily installed properly by non-specialists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open code base.&lt;/strong&gt; An open code base allows for infinitely many sets of eyes to review the code, and infinitely many developers to fix any vulnerabilities found.  Open code bases do &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; mean the code is secure.  However, there are generally fewer issues, and when issues are found they are addressed faster. They also tend to be widely deployed and tend to be less complex to install and maintain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bug Bounty Program&lt;/strong&gt;. Public, open &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugcrowd.com/list-of-bug-bounty-programs&#34;&gt;Bug Bounty Programs&lt;/a&gt; encourage vulnerability research in a responsible manner. As an economist by training I believe when the rewards for good behavior are there you tend to get good behavior. If not, only bad behavior is rewarded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conditions-for-low-security-levels&#34;&gt;Conditions for low security levels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not widely deployed&lt;/strong&gt; The less widely the technology is deployed and used the fewer opportunities we have to gather good data about it’s security profile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not frequently attacked, or successful attacks are generally not disclosed.&lt;/strong&gt; This goes hand in glove with the above point. One issue with vendor sofware used in specialized applications within companies is that successful attacks may not be recognized/known, and/or they may not be disclosed. This gives us low information quality about the actual security performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficult to install and configure properly.&lt;/strong&gt; ERP applications such as SAP are notoriously complex and difficult to install. The database has over 70,000 tables excluding Y and Z tables, the overall system takes days to setup by highly trained specialists. The attack surface is quite large. SAP may not be a good example because security is good by default and we rarely hear about successful breaches - but the risk in the complexity is real.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closed code base&lt;/strong&gt; If you have to ask your vendor “is it secure?” then it’s not.  Security isn&amp;rsquo;t something you can provide an answer to unless you&amp;rsquo;re selling snake oil. If the vendor says: “It&amp;rsquo;s secure. We did not put in any back doors. We audited the code ourselves. There are not any kernel level hacks, root kits, or otherwise. This has been tested against a variety of anti-virus scanners and none of them flagged anything. We&amp;rsquo;re very good. Please, please trust us.” then you should know that they are telling you what you want, or need to hear. You could read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb457059.aspx&#34;&gt;WinXP pamphlet&lt;/a&gt; on security back when it was released and it had endless bullet points about how secure it was. It was probably the least secure software in the history of computing based on actual attacks after the fact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;it-s-secure-until-it-s-not&#34;&gt;It’s secure… until it’s not&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1770s Joseph Bramah created a lock that was vastly superior to any the world ever seen. Bramah believed it was 100% theft-proof. Bramah was so confident in his design that he published a pamphlet detailing exactly how it worked and he put it in the window of his London storefront, and painted on it a challenge:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The artist who can make an instrument that will pick or open this lock shall receive 200 Guineas the moment it is produced.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Jeremiah Chubb created the Chubb detector lock. The way Chubb’s lock worked was that if a lock picker tried to lift one of the tumblers up too high, a latching mechanism would trigger, causing the lock to seize up. When that happened, even the key wouldn’t open the lock. To reset the lock, the owner would have to put in a different key and rotate it in the opposite direction to reset the tumblers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, if lock owners went to unlock a chest, or a vault, or a front door, and found that their key didn’t work, they would know that someone had tried to get in—and that they had failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 70 years, the names Chubb and Bramah meant “perfect security”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1851, London was hosting The Great Exhibition—the first international exhibition of manufactured products. One of the attendees was A. C. Hobbs, an American locksmith. Back in the states, Hobbs had made a name for himself by showing bank managers that their locks could be easily picked, and convincing them to buy one of his. Hobbs was selling lots of locks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On day one of the exhibition, Hobbs publicly announced that he would pick the Chubb detector lock — the one that stops working if you pick it incorrectly. It took Hobbs about 25 minutes. And the way Hobbs did it was to use the lock against itself.
He would pick it until he tripped the detector mechanism, causing the lock to seize up. That would give Hobbs information about how it worked, and then he would pick the lock in the opposite direction to reset the detector. He’d go back and forth firing and resetting the detector until the lock told him everything he needed to know about how to get it open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Chubb detector lock was really just a warm up. The main event was the Bramah safety lock—the one with the challenge painted on it in gold lettering, which had been sitting Bramah’s storefront window for 70 years, unbeaten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After working on the lock for about 52 hours over the course of fourteen days, Hobbs opened it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overnight, the feeling of perfect security had evaporated. And we have never gotten it back.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Automate Code Reviews?</title>
      <link>http://danstroot.com/2015/09/26/why-automate-code-reviews</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://danstroot.com/2015/09/26/why-automate-code-reviews</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask a programmer to review 10 lines of code, they&amp;rsquo;ll make 10 suggestions. Ask them to review 1,000 lines of code and they&amp;rsquo;ll say &amp;ldquo;it looks good!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people have begun integrating bots into the GitHub ecosystem for code review. For example the folks who created the Bootstrap UI framework created a bot called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github/twbs/rorshach&#34;&gt;rorshach&lt;/a&gt; to perform sanity checks on pull requests. If the sanity check fails it leaves a nice informative comment, explaining the issue and how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another example at &lt;a href=&#34;https://betterdiff.com/&#34;&gt;BetterDiff&lt;/a&gt;. The idea there is that instead of having humans go through and give cursory reviews, you have a round of automated review by bots (using normal, industry-standard tooling) and it comments on the pull request just like a reviewer would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty soon I expect to see &amp;ldquo;when tests pass, and code reviews pass, then go ahead and merge the code&amp;rdquo; bots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fintech Startups Tug the Industy Forward</title>
      <link>http://danstroot.com/2015/06/15/fintech-startups-tug-the-industry-forward</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Jun 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://danstroot.com/2015/06/15/fintech-startups-tug-the-industry-forward</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;lazy img-rounded img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=&#34; alt=&#34;FinTech&#34; data-src=&#34;/assets/img/billguard.png&#34; width=&#34;750&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial services companies are among the most highly regulated industries in the world.  They also suffer from a trust issue.  Trust is a key ingredient in making a financial services business viable. Why would I ever buy insurance, banking services or invest my savings via a company that I didn’t trust?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the sub-prime debt crisis in 2008 it became clear that the financial services industry would need to rebuild it’s image. Companies would need to zealously rebuild their brands to aspire to become “trusted advisors”. From an IT standpoint it is crystal clear that client and corporate data must be guarded and protected to prevent any loss as well as minimize the potential for damage to an organization’s reputation. How to manage the risk and yet stay innovative?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The response by some financial services companies is to stick their head in the sand and avoid &amp;ldquo;the cloud&amp;rdquo;, open source technologies, and try to make their networks ever more restrictive. This backfires in several ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their economics are always working against them relative to more open competitors, which they justify by convincing themselves that they are more secure and it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;worth it&amp;rdquo;. However managed properly their competitors are just as secure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their employees skills go stale. Since IT personnel cost so much the result is  mismanging a key resource.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By outsourcing aspects of their security to companies like Oracle, Microsoft and IBM they convince themselves they are more secure.  Does anyone know how many vulnerabilities there have been in the .NET framework &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-26/product_id-2002/Microsoft-.net-Framework.html&#34;&gt;over the years&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employees will begin actively circumventing security when it impedes their ability to do their job. I&amp;rsquo;ve met employees who use their personal laptops on open Wi-Fi because they tell me they can&amp;rsquo;t work on their corporate laptop and network because it is so locked down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s even worse than the problems listed above is the &lt;strong&gt;market never stands still&lt;/strong&gt;.  Your future competitors are today&amp;rsquo;s startups. FinTech companies are improving payment processes, reducing fraud, saving users money, promoting financial planning and responsibility, improving lending, and ultimately moving a giant, cautious industry forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we look at a recent article in Forbes that profiles &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forbes.com/sites/ilyapozin/2014/12/14/15-fintech-startups-to-watch-in-2015/&#34;&gt;15 FinTech startups to watch in 2015&lt;/a&gt; we can then also peek at the technologies they are using as see where the future lies with financial services:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.billguard.com/&#34;&gt;BillGuard&lt;/a&gt;: nginx, Apache, postmark, ZenDesk, Amazon AWS, Cloudflare&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://planwise.com/&#34;&gt;PlanWise&lt;/a&gt;: nginx, Apache, MailChimp, Wordpress, PHP, Fastly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ondeck.com/home-qualify/&#34;&gt;OnDeck&lt;/a&gt;: nginx, Azure, Wordpress, PHP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wealthfront.com/&#34;&gt;WealthFront&lt;/a&gt;: nginx, Amazon AWS, Cloudfront&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.currencycloud.com/&#34;&gt;CurrencyCloud&lt;/a&gt;: nginx, Varnish, Mandrill, Cloudflare, Google Apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://stripe.com/&#34;&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt;: nginx, Amazon AWS, Mandrill, Ruby on Rails, Google Apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.epiphyte.com/&#34;&gt;Epiphyte&lt;/a&gt;: Office 365, Azure, Node.js/Express, Bootstrap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.astropaycard.com/&#34;&gt;AstroPay&lt;/a&gt;: nginx, Amazon AWS, PHP, AngularJS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bankingup.com/&#34;&gt;BankingUp&lt;/a&gt;: Apache, Google Apps,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://squareup.com/&#34;&gt;Square&lt;/a&gt;: nginx, Ruby on Rails, Amazon Cloudfront CDN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tipalti.com/&#34;&gt;Tipalti&lt;/a&gt;: IIS, nginx, Google Apps, Rackspace, Wordpress, PHP, .NET&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flint.com/&#34;&gt;Flint&lt;/a&gt;: Apache, Amazon AWS, Google Apps, PHP, Akamai CDN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[Check] - Acquired by Intuit (no info available)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zipmark.com/&#34;&gt;Zipmark&lt;/a&gt;: Cowboy(erlang), Postmark, Google Apps, Amazon AWS, Ruby on Rails, Heroku&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wepay.com/&#34;&gt;WePay&lt;/a&gt;: nginx, Amazon AWS, Mailgun, Zendesk, Google Apps, Akamai CDN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can we take away from this list?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fintech startups are not afraid of open source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fintech startups are taking advantange of cloud economics and scale (AWS, Rackspace and Azure as examples).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fintech startups are not afraid of using other &amp;ldquo;startup&amp;rdquo; services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet they also must be solving the security issue as well - what the most tenuous point in any companies lifespan and the one where trust matters the most?  The startup phase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will this mean for incumbent companies that refuse to change? Maybe in the future they will be both secure and irrelevant.  Or worse, maybe just irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Make Big Bets</title>
      <link>http://danstroot.com/2015/01/22/make-big-bets</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://danstroot.com/2015/01/22/make-big-bets</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;lazy img-rounded img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=&#34; alt=&#34;Open Data&#34; data-src=&#34;/assets/img/african_children.jpg&#34; width=&#34;750&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation just released it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gatesnotes.com/2015-annual-letter?page=0&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;WT.mc_id=01_21_2015_AL2015-GF_GFO_domain_Top_21&#34;&gt;annual letter&lt;/a&gt;.  I have come to look forward to these letters because I find them incredibly inspiring. This year instead of an annual update they are re-baselining and taking a fifteen year view of the future. As I read this year&amp;rsquo;s letter I was simultaneously moved, inspired and awed by the scope their mission:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lives of people in poor countries will improve faster in the next 15 years than &lt;strong&gt;at any other time in history&lt;/strong&gt;. And their lives will improve more than anyone else&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- 2015 Gates Annual Letter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four pillars to accomplish this mission:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Farming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Education&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My daughter and I spent 10 days traveling in Uganda several years ago with our friends Jeff Jensen and his daughter Caroline.  We traveled fairly extensively and visited a number of charitable organizations in and around Kampala and Gulu.  It&amp;rsquo;s hard to appreciate how far ahead we are economically unless you experience it first hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the places we visited was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.krochetkids.org/&#34;&gt;Krochet Kids&lt;/a&gt; in Gulu. They are the largest employer of women in the area. They provide job training, a fair wage to lift them and their families out of poverty, and a positive family-oriented environment. On a side note you can buy their products in Nordstrom!  This picture is &amp;ldquo;the factory&amp;rdquo; on the day we visited:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;lazy img-rounded img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=&#34; alt=&#34;Open Data&#34; data-src=&#34;/assets/img/krochet-kids.jpg&#34; width=&#34;750&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see the women get to sit in the shade of large trees, children are welcome, and they are encouraged to socialize as they work. The women I met were very happy and grateful for the opportunity.  However we found out that when the women got paid (cash - they do not have bank accounts) their husbands would take the money.  Some husbands would go drinking or find other ways to spend the money unwisely. The women were not empowered culturally to resist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The founders of Krochet Kids decided they needed to find a way to create a type of bank where the women could protect their wages. If they didn&amp;rsquo;t bring home cash their husbands would not have access to it. The key was to find a way to allow them to save money in an account, and also possibly loan each other money.  The Village Savings and Loans Association (VSLA) was born. Currently on any given week there is roughly $10,000 being saved in the VSLA. The VSLA now offers small loans to women in the group and collects and divides any interest incurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Krochet Kids discovered was that in some ways the most valuable service they provided was not &amp;ldquo;a job&amp;rdquo; but rather training and mentorship on personal budgeting, savings, loans and business management topics.  One of their stated goals is now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To equip the women of Northern Uganda with the financial assets and knowledge to enter into the local economy and thereby end their dependence on humanitarian aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When reading this year&amp;rsquo;s Gates Letter Mobile Banking is one of the four pillars of the fifteen year plan. I have seen firsthand how empowering this can be.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Keep it Simple... UX Design</title>
      <link>http://danstroot.com/2015/01/13/kiss-my-ux</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://danstroot.com/2015/01/13/kiss-my-ux</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;lazy img-rounded img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=&#34; alt=&#34;Open Data&#34; data-src=&#34;/assets/img/iron_man.png&#34; width=&#34;750&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having done some user interface work over the break I discovered that my design approach was basically to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look around the web for things that I liked and then proceed to &amp;lsquo;borrow&amp;rsquo; their aesthetic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverage UX/UI frameworks such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://getbootstrap.com&#34;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://foundation.zurb.com/&#34;&gt;Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining a framework with something I think &amp;ldquo;looks cool&amp;rdquo; is a quick win.  I can get something created quickly that has an incredible amount of time and effort already baked in to making it usable, responsive and approachable.  Given the very wide of use of these frameworks I suspect many others work this way, but also since users are used to seeing many sites built with these frameworks it creates sense of familiarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am definitely not a designer and usually this is a cerebral as I get when it comes to UX/UI design work but I decide to step back and think about what we were trying accomplish. For example what are the base principles that could guide us?  I found some good material from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nngroup.com/&#34;&gt;Nielsen Norman Group&lt;/a&gt; that I want to share (I hope it&amp;rsquo;s OK).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nielsen&amp;rsquo;s 10 Heuristic Design Principles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;####VISIBILITY OF SYSTEM STATUS
The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.
####MATCH BETWEEN SYSTEM AND THE REAL WORLD
The system should speak the users&amp;rsquo; language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.
####USER CONTROL AND FREEDOM
Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked &amp;ldquo;emergency exit&amp;rdquo; to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.
####CONSISTENCY AND STANDARDS
Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.
####ERROR PREVENTION
Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.
####RECOGNITION RATHER THAN RECALL
Minimize the user&amp;rsquo;s memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.
####FLEXIBILITY AND EFFICIENCY OF USE
Accelerators &amp;ndash; unseen by the novice user &amp;ndash; may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.
####AESTHETIC AND MINIMALIST DESIGN
Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.
####HELP USERS RECOGNIZE, DIAGNOSE, AND RECOVER FROM ERRORS
Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.
####HELP AND DOCUMENTATION
Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user&amp;rsquo;s task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main area that I struggle with is keeping it simple and minimal.  I tend to want to create &amp;ldquo;Tony Stark&amp;rdquo; approved interfaces, yet in the real world I strongly prefer clean simplicity. Check out this example from the retailer Victoria Beckham:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;lazy img-rounded img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=&#34; alt=&#34;Open Data&#34; data-src=&#34;/assets/img/VICTORIA_BECKHAM.png&#34; width=&#34;750&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The product is front and center and draws your eye.  The navigation is minimal.  The buying options are as limited as possible, you can only choose your size.  Yet there is nothing missing - I can get more details if I want, or a size guide if needed.  To me, this is oustanding UI/UX.  It is clean, simple and usable, and it highlights the product and only the product. What is your ideal UI/UX?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sources:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nngroup.com/&#34;&gt;Nielsen Norman Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.victoriabeckham.com&#34;&gt;Victoria Beckham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://userium.com/&#34;&gt;Userium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>President Obama&#39;s Plan for a Free and Open Internet</title>
      <link>http://danstroot.com/2014/11/10/obama-net-neutrality</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://danstroot.com/2014/11/10/obama-net-neutrality</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;lazy img-rounded img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=&#34; alt=&#34;Open Data&#34; data-src=&#34;/assets/img/obama_internet.png&#34; width=&#34;750&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today President Barack Obama has come out in favor of net neutrality in very public way.  He lays out in no uncertain terms that he believes no cable company or access provider should be able to put limits on access to the Internet. In addition, he’s suggesting that the FCC recognizes access to the Internet as a basic utility, and something that Americans have a basic right to. This means no blocking, no throttling, more transparency and no paid prioritization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the four principles quoted directly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No blocking.&lt;/strong&gt; If a consumer requests access to a website or service, and the content is legal, your ISP should not be permitted to block it. That way, every player — not just those commercially affiliated with an ISP — gets a fair shot at your business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No throttling.&lt;/strong&gt; Nor should ISPs be able to intentionally slow down some content or speed up others — through a process often called “throttling” — based on the type of service or your ISP’s preferences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased transparency.&lt;/strong&gt; The connection between consumers and ISPs — the so-called “last mile” — is not the only place some sites might get special treatment. So, I am also asking the FCC to make full use of the transparency authorities the court recently upheld, and if necessary to apply net neutrality rules to points of interconnection between the ISP and the rest of the Internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No paid prioritization.&lt;/strong&gt; Simply put: No service should be stuck in a “slow lane” because it does not pay a fee. That kind of gatekeeping would undermine the level playing field essential to the Internet’s growth. So, as I have before, I am asking for an explicit ban on paid prioritization and any other restriction that has a similar effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether you are on the &amp;ldquo;red team&amp;rdquo; or the &amp;ldquo;blue team&amp;rdquo; - this is a noble goal and one I hope everyone supports. An open Internet benefits us all in a myriad of ways and allows a free and open exchange of ideas across society. I&amp;rsquo;d urge you to read &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.raptitude.com/2014/11/the-gift/&#34;&gt;The Greatest Gift We Ever Had&lt;/a&gt;.  Key quote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;honest, inclusive conversation across a society will reliably lead to equality and higher quality of life, in any place it is allowed to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###My Thoughts:
* There is one principle missing: &lt;strong&gt;No Content Modification.&lt;/strong&gt; ISPs should not be allowed to modify any of the content they transport.  This prevents them from injecting beacons, tracking code, advertising, etc. into web content that they are entrusted to deliver.  This is happening and it needs to be stopped.
* &amp;ldquo;Government Regulation&amp;rdquo; is known to increase costs, and potentially reduce growth and innovation.  All things being equal I am in favor of less regulation rather than more regulation.  We need to tread carefully as we seek to increase regulation to protect openness (bit of an oxymoron isn&amp;rsquo;t it?).
* We have to think carefully about the paid access issue. Does &amp;ldquo;no slow lanes&amp;rdquo; also mean &amp;ldquo;No Fast Lanes&amp;rdquo;?  What if I want an ISP to provide a service where I get premium access to YouTube content, or Netflix content?  Should that be illegal?
* It is not a requirement that ISPs block unlawful content, rather it is a prohibition on blocking lawful content. But a strong enough prohibition on blocking lawful content (e.g., one which provides consequences whenever lawful content is blocked, even if the intent was to block unlawful content and the lawful content just got caught up in the filter) actually reduces the incentive for ISPs to attempt to identify and block unlawful content, since attempting to do so but making a misidentification in the process can result in penalties.  In other words access to child pornography, terrorist information, and illicit drugs could actually increase as a result (i.e. &amp;ldquo;the law of unintended consequences&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###Here is President Obama&amp;rsquo;s Video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- 16:9 aspect ratio --&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe class=&#34;embed-responsive-item&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/uKcjQPVwfDk&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###Update:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who considers himself a Republican It saddens me that this issue has become so polarized along party lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Net Neutrality&amp;quot; is Obamacare for the Internet; the Internet should not operate at the speed of government.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SenTedCruz/status/531834493922189313&#34;&gt;November 10, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only similarity to the Affordable Care Act is that Obama supports it. There may be a rational, reasoned argument against Net Neutrality, but Republicans aren’t making it, and neither are the cable companies or cellular providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main thrust seems to be &amp;ldquo;Government regulation of the Internet will be bad.&amp;rdquo;  And yet, we seem to have no issues regulating banks, power utilities, telephone companies and other utilities.  The other argument seems to be the &amp;ldquo;slippery slope&amp;rdquo; argument - by introducing goverment regulation it is easy to envision that we will soon start regulating &lt;strong&gt;content&lt;/strong&gt;.  However, with our country&amp;rsquo;s foundation on free speech I find that argument quite a stretch and exactly the opposite of Obama&amp;rsquo;s first principle: &amp;ldquo;No Blocking&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sources:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>USA&#39;s Digital Playbook</title>
      <link>http://danstroot.com/2014/08/12/usa-digital-playbook</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://danstroot.com/2014/08/12/usa-digital-playbook</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;lazy img-rounded img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=&#34; alt=&#34;Open Data&#34; data-src=&#34;/assets/img/USDS_Playbook.png&#34; width=&#34;750&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White House announced on Monday, August 11th 2014, that it is formally launching a new U.S. Digital Service and that it has hired Mikey Dickerson to lead it.  Mickey Dickerson is an engineer widely credited with playing a central role in salvaging HealthCare.gov. The idea behind the USDS is institutionalizing the approach that saved the US health care website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USDS is launching with a pair of foundational texts: &lt;a href=&#34;https://playbook.cio.gov/&#34;&gt;A Digital Services Playbook&lt;/a&gt; with 13 key &amp;lsquo;plays&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; for implementing digital government and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/WhiteHouse/playbook/blob/gh-pages/_includes/techfar-online.md&#34;&gt;TechFAR Handbook&lt;/a&gt; to advise agencies on how to take a more agile approach to federal contracting and procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I read through the digital playbook I was struck by the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s full of common sense, elegantly designed, has clear navigation, and is responsive to any device you choose to view it upon. In other words it is nothing like any official government documentation I have ever seen before.  Oh, and it&amp;rsquo;s hosted on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The playbook is basically applied common sense and smart best practices from silicon valley.  In other words &amp;ldquo;it works&amp;rdquo; because it&amp;rsquo;s the same playbook employed by web giants like Google, Facebook and Twitter and nearly all web startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a CIO I think the playbook should really be &lt;strong&gt;everyone&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/strong&gt; playbook - it&amp;rsquo;s very good and worth a read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;let-s-talk-about-open-government-first&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Talk About Open Government First&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama, on his first day in office in 2009, signed an executive order stating that all government information that did not have to be kept secret for security or privacy reasons should be made public. The administration also launched the Open Data Initiative to publish government data and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.data.gov/&#34;&gt;data.gov&lt;/a&gt; website to distribute the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Administration is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in Government. We will work together to ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration. Openness will strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness in Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_- &lt;a href=&#34;http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/news/20090121/2009_transparency_memo.pdf&#34;&gt;President Barack Obama, January 21, 2009&lt;/a&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huge strides have been made by the &amp;ldquo;Open Government&amp;rdquo; movement. Today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Citizens and government leaders alike now expect government data to be accessible, transparent and machine-readable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further, 67.9 percent of people surveyed believe that “Government data is the property of taxpayers and should be free to all citizens.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By a margin of three to one people said they are more likely to vote for politicians who champion data transparency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-s-progressed-far-quicker-than-we-expected&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s progressed far quicker than we expected&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The United States Government maintains its &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/project-open-data/project-open-data.github.io&#34;&gt;Open Data Policy&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub! Anyone can fork the policy, edit it, and submit a pull request to have their edits adopted in a fully open process, exactly like creating open source software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open data is a global movement. More than 40 countries — from every region of the world and at every stage of development — have established open data initiatives. These nations are opening up all kinds of data sets to promote economic development, spark innovation, and find ways to make government operate better. India has released 3,500 data
sets, mostly of agricultural information. Singapore has shared 8,600 data sets
from 60 public agencies, and just this year Australian budget data was made available in machine-readable form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has published a set of standards (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:37120:ed-1:v1:en&#34;&gt;ISO 37120&lt;/a&gt;) that specifies the relevant metrics for city services and quality of life. This will let researchers and citizens evaluate any city based on a uniform set of metrics. Furthermore, ISO 37120 confirms and accelerates the momentum of the open data movement and now provides a common framework within which all cities can participate. It is a gateway to smarter cities (and citizens).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cities have embraced the open government movement and opened up their data to the public. Here are some examples:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://performance.lacity.org/&#34;&gt;Los Angeles City Metrics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://data.lacity.org/&#34;&gt;DataLA (LA Data Portal)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nycopendata.socrata.com/&#34;&gt;New York City Open Data Portal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://data.cityofboston.gov/&#34;&gt;City of Boston Data Portal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-has-a-far-larger-economic-potential-than-we-expected&#34;&gt;It has a far larger economic potential than we expected&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The benefits of open data are self-reinforcing: they increase as individuals access the data and help to improve the accuracy and detail of the information available. As people see the value in the data they will use it to create innovation and growth.  It also drives trust as government leaders and officials can now be more easily measured and held accountable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.omidyar.com/sites/default/files/file_archive/insights/ON%20Report_061114_FNL.pdf&#34;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by Lateral Economics and the Omidyar Network finds that, by implementing open data policies, G20 countries could increase their cumulative GDP by $13 trillion over the next five years, because open data attracts private infrastructure investment, creates jobs, strengthens tax systems, and fights corruption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A report by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/open_data_unlocking_innovation_and_performance_with_liquid_information&#34;&gt;McKinsey &amp;amp; Co.&lt;/a&gt;  suggests that seven sectors alone could generate more than $3 trillion a year in additional value as a result of open data, which is already giving rise to hundreds of entrepreneurial businesses and helping established companies to segment markets, define new products and services, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-few-words-about-open-science&#34;&gt;A Few Words About Open Science&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science can be broadly described as collecting, analyzing, publishing, reanalyzing, critiquing, and reusing data. Interestingly, the open data movement in science predates the Internet. The concept of open access to scientific data was institutionally established in the mid-20th century when the International Council of Scientific Unions (now the International Council for Science) established several World Data Centers to minimize the risk of data loss and to maximize data accessibility, further recommending in &lt;strong&gt;1955&lt;/strong&gt; that data be made available in machine-readable form. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.icsu-wds.org/organization&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like open government, there are some commonly held beliefs about making scientific data publicly available:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Data belongs to the human race&amp;rdquo;. Typical examples are genomes, data on organisms, medical science, and environmental data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open data enables open peer review, which in turn creates better science.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In scientific research, the rate of discovery is accelerated by better access to data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sponsors of research do not get full value unless the resulting data is made publicly available. Or, put another way, trust in sponsored research increases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result has been a &lt;a href=&#34;http://thecostofknowledge.com/&#34;&gt;strong backlash&lt;/a&gt; to the current publishing practices and keeping scientific data behind paywalls.  To date nearly fifteen thousand scientists have signed a petition for the right of authors to achieve easily accessible distribution of their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s clear that that the concepts of open data benefit science, and the platforms we discuss below could be used to further the goals of open science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-open-data-looks-like&#34;&gt;What Open Data Looks Like&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goals, metrics and discoveries must be transparent.  Here are examples from city data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;lazy img-rounded img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=&#34; alt=&#34;Goals&#34; data-src=&#34;/assets/img/goals.png&#34; width=&#34;750&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;lazy img-rounded img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=&#34; alt=&#34;Goals&#34; data-src=&#34;/assets/img/goals_metric.png&#34; width=&#34;750&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;lazy img-rounded img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=&#34; alt=&#34;Open Data&#34; data-src=&#34;/assets/img/open_data.png&#34; width=&#34;750&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Datasets supporting the goals, metrics and discoveries must be publicly available, along with other supporting data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;lazy img-rounded img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=&#34; alt=&#34;Data Catalog&#34; data-src=&#34;/assets/img/data_catalog.png&#34; width=&#34;750&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Platforms have sprung up to support the open government movement. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.socrata.com/&#34;&gt;Socrata&lt;/a&gt; appears to have market leadership in this space and has a very complete vision of what an open data platform looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;lazy img-rounded img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=&#34; alt=&#34;Socrata&#34; data-src=&#34;/assets/img/socrata.png&#34; width=&#34;750&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-open-data-corporation&#34;&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Open Data&amp;rdquo; Corporation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open data is fast becoming a defining theme for business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We all know that data is essential for management decision-making and strategic insight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enlightened organizations understand that data is a strategic corporate asset and foundational to operational excellence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies understand that internal clarity and efficiency requires &amp;ldquo;a single version of the truth&amp;rdquo;, and making data accessible is one of the first steps on this journey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrated data from open sources and social media now allows a 360-degree view of customers, suppliers, products and markets and can generate new product ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how many companies today are committed to open data across the enterprise, or know how to implement an open data initiative? Many organizations still behave as if data is a by-product of the systems that generate and use it, and nothing more.  The data stays locked into those systems and is inaccessible to those without a seat license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some organizations are &amp;ldquo;shy&amp;rdquo; about sharing actual business performance data openly with their employees. This breeds mistrust of course.  Some departments may not like openly sharing their data and metrics (what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the average time to resolve a customer complaint?). Some people like to hoard data, giving them power in the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that unlocking value requires open data, and open data deserves deliberate investment, resources, headcount, and technology support – just like a company’s other corporate assets – is starting to sound like common sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;why-not-have-an-enterprise-architecture-that-is-defined-by-data-instead-of-services&#34;&gt;Why not have an enterprise architecture that is defined by &lt;strong&gt;data&lt;/strong&gt; instead of &lt;strong&gt;services&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past we have made several runs at enterprise architectures that were defined by services.  Best known is &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture&#34;&gt;Service Oriented Architecture&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; (SOA) which defined services that performed self-contained units of functionality, such as retrieving a customer record.  Services could then be combined and reused to perform business processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some challenges of this approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It went against the trend towards buying sofware instead of building it - if I buy SAP what services does it expose?  Do I have to build my own services &lt;em&gt;on top of SAP&lt;/em&gt;? If so, what happens when I upgrade SAP and the data model changes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Service discovery and reuse are hard problems in large environments, and it is also hard to maintain coherence and integrity of services. Metadata is necessary, like a catalogue, to perform discovery of services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Processes that require managing application or process &amp;ldquo;state&amp;rdquo; are difficult to build.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initially there were many technical ways to build services - starting with Remote Procedure Calls (RPC), then Java Business Integration (JBI), Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and data distribution service (DDS) and Simple Object Oriented Protocol (SOAP), which led us to concept of &amp;ldquo;Web Services&amp;rdquo; and the Web Services Description Language (WSDL). In short, a mess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not invert the concept of services and start with data? Instead of starting with the concept of a customer object and then designing services to update the object lets just buy some licenses of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.salesforce.com/&#34;&gt;Salesforce.com&lt;/a&gt;.  Now I have all the &amp;ldquo;services&amp;rdquo; I need to manage customer data.  The challenge is how do I share that data with other applications in the company, or people without Salesforce seat licenses?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today on the web we generally use the REST (REpresentational State Transfer) design pattern. This means that the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations are specified by using HTTP methods to create APIs.  We can consume these APIs in applications or websites with technologies like AJAX.  A catalog and metadata is necessary, and this catalog must be usable by both humans and machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the example above we would use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api_rest/&#34;&gt;Salesforce REST API&lt;/a&gt;.  If we were to take other datasets in the company, particularly those without REST APIs, and make them available in an online catalog like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.socrata.com/&#34;&gt;Socrata&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; we then get a REST API &amp;ldquo;built-in&amp;rdquo;. Now the data is both discoverable and usable anywhere in the organization!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been notoriously difficult to share and integrate data across an enterpise and using a data-centric approach and REST APIs may be an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-benefits-of-open-data-in-businesses&#34;&gt;Other Benefits of Open Data in Businesses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;leaders-are-more-trusted&#34;&gt;Leaders are more trusted&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know people are more likely to vote for politicians who who champion data transparency, but guess what? People are also more like to trust and follow leaders who who champion data transparency inside their organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;organizations-perform-better&#34;&gt;Organizations perform better&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open data can, and should be, linked to strategic goals.  Are your organizations goals transparent?  Are the metrics supporting those goals transparent?  Is the actual data of the performance of the company against those goals shared openly across the firm?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many organizations create grandiose plans and goals that make for wonderful slideware.  When it comes to tying them to hard metrics and then rigourously and publicly sharing progress many fall short.  This means inside the organization the &amp;ldquo;chaos of competing priorities&amp;rdquo; continues and the company lacks focus and ultimately performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;value-is-unlocked&#34;&gt;Value is unlocked&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open data can bring fresh insights into how companies operate and help management identify and eliminate &amp;ldquo;the sand in the gears&amp;rdquo; and other barriers to productivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies can choose to share proprietary data to create benchmarks that can improve overall industry performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using open data, such as customer discussions on social media, companies can refine product requirements and create new products and services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies can even consider ways in which to monetize the value of their data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-few-words-about-information-security&#34;&gt;A few words about information security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, &amp;ldquo;open data&amp;rdquo; sounds like it runs counter to everything we have been taught about information security and the principle of &amp;ldquo;least priviledge&amp;rdquo;. To be clear, there is information in an organization addressed by privacy laws, HIPAA, PCI and various and sundry other laws and regulations. This data must (of course) be protected as prescribed - even so, having a record of the datasets involved and who &amp;ldquo;owns&amp;rdquo; them is actually useful for both open data purposes (because it makes the fact we have the data, and who owns it, visible even if the dataset itself is not exposed) as well as information security requirements - security begins with information ownership and knowing who can grant/revoke access to sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets also keep things in perspective - the vast majority of data in most organizations is simply &amp;ldquo;internal data&amp;rdquo; and is not confidential or sensitive. Yet it is information that people need to perform their jobs and often they struggle to find it, or use stale data, because they just don&amp;rsquo;t know where to go or who to contact for the information - sand in the gears of daily operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, REST API&amp;rsquo;s are able to be secured, usually via a key or OAuth athentication strategy so that open data doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to mean &amp;ldquo;openly accessible&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about how open data could apply to your business:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you know what the key operational metrics of your company are?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How transparent are those metrics?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you know which datasets support those metrics?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you know all the data that is available in your company? Is there a catalog of datasets?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you know who is &lt;em&gt;responsible&lt;/em&gt; for the data (i.e. the data owner or steward)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How accessible is the data?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can data be explicitly shared, and when shared, can the dataset owner/publisher specify the role for each grantee - editor, viewer, etc.?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If data cannot be shared do we at least know who &amp;ldquo;owns&amp;rdquo; or is responsible for it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it available for download in any reasonable format needed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it accessible via an API so your internal developers can work with it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can your organization consume open data from outside sources easily and make it available across the company?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sources:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;lazy img-rounded img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=&#34; alt=&#34;CoreOS&#34; data-src=&#34;/assets/img/coreos-logo.png&#34; width=&#34;594&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been playing around with CoreOS to get a sense of how everything works. The vision of this project is incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CoreOS describes itself as &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;a new Linux distribution that has been re-architected to provide features needed to run modern infrastructure stacks. The strategies and architectures that influence CoreOS allow companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter to run their services at scale with high resilience.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CoreOS displaces hypervisors and machine virtualization in favor of Docker and Linux containers.  CoreOS uses Linux containers to manage your services at a high level of abstraction. A single service&amp;rsquo;s code and all dependencies are packaged within a container that can be run on one or many CoreOS machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clustering works across platforms, meaning there is no cloud vendor lock-in. For example, CoreOS runs on Amazon EC2, Rackspace, QEMU/KVM, VMware and OpenStack and your own hardware. Running a single CoreOS cluster on multiple different clouds or cloud + bare metal is supported and encouraged. This lack of lock-in is the reason why I have supported OpenStack and CoreOS takes this even further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;we-begin-with-concept-of-a-large-fleet-of-machines-that-start-and-remain-exactly-consistent-at-the-os-level&#34;&gt;We begin with concept of a large fleet of machines that start (and remain) exactly consistent at the OS level.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, think of CoreOS somewhat like you might think of a hypervisor today.  It is the first layer you put down on bare metal, or as a virtual machine in a cloud. It is a &amp;ldquo;bare minimum&amp;rdquo; Linux-based OS that supports Linux LXC containers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is designed to run as a large fleet (hive?) of machines. It includes built-in primitives such as distributed locking and master election, plus key services necessary to manage the fleet of machines. (more on this later).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is meant to always be consistent across machines.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CoreOS utilizes an active/passive dual-partition scheme to update the OS as a &lt;em&gt;single unit&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;package by package&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CoreOS also has the tenant of &lt;strong&gt;automatically&lt;/strong&gt; updating itself. This avoids the issue of inconsistent state from machine to machine within a large cluster. Conceptually this is roughly like a self-updating hypervisor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each machine has to acquire and hold a reboot lock before it is allowed to reboot. The reboot lock is held until the machine releases it after a successful update. The number of machines allowed to reboot simultaneously is configurable. The main goal to allow for an update to be applied to a fleet quickly, without impacting capacity for the services running on the cluster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;next-we-have-the-concept-that-the-fleet-of-machines-is-simply-a-single-pool-of-compute-resources&#34;&gt;Next, we have the concept that the fleet of machines is simply a single pool of compute resources.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You treat your CoreOS cluster as if it has a single, shared init system - one giant systemd if you will.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of running a service on a specific machine, services are submitted to the cluster via the cluster manager, fleetctl, which decides where they should run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your services/applications are in containers that act as small, ephemeral units that can easily migrate around a cluster of self-updating CoreOS machines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is smart enough to distribute services across a cluster using machine-level affinity or anti-affinity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your application consists of 5 containers fleet will guarantee that they stay running somewhere on the cluster. If a machine fails or needs to be updated, containers running on that machine will be moved to other qualified machines in the cluster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;with-a-single-shared-brain&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip; with a single, shared brain&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CoreOS provides a distributed key value store called &amp;ldquo;etcd&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The etcd client runs on each machine in a cluster. etcd gracefully handles master election during network partitions and the loss of the current master.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Docker containers can read, write and listen to etcd over the docker0 network interface. With these three actions you construct extremely sophisticated orchestration to happen whenever etcd values change. An example of this would be listening for changes and then to reconfigure an upstream proxy when a new container of an application is started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since etcd is replicated, all changes are reflected across the entire cluster. Your application can always reach the local etcd instance at 127.0.0.1:4001.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your applications can read and write data into etcd. Common examples are storing database connection details, cache settings, feature flags, and more. Let&amp;rsquo;s say we&amp;rsquo;re running a simple web app like Wordpress. Instead of hardcoding our database address with in the config file, we&amp;rsquo;ll fetch it from etcd instead. It&amp;rsquo;s as simple as curl-ing &lt;a href=&#34;http://127.0.0.1:4001/v1/keys/database&#34;&gt;http://127.0.0.1:4001/v1/keys/database&lt;/a&gt; and using the response within your DB connection code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;##Summary&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now we have a hive of self-updating Linux hosts with a single, distributed init system (systemd and fleet) and a single shared brain (etcd).  It looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;lazy img-rounded img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=&#34; alt=&#34;CoreOS in Action&#34; data-src=&#34;/assets/img/coreos-action.png&#34; width=&#34;750&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This depicts eight containers (two load balancers and six api servers) being managed by &amp;ldquo;fleet&amp;rdquo; to run in various CoreOS hosts in the cluster, with shared access to etcd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Momentum is shifting this way rapidly. Earlier this month Rackspace announced &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rackspace.com/blog/onmetal-the-right-way-to-scale/&#34;&gt;OnMetal&lt;/a&gt;. Rackspace&amp;rsquo;s OnMetal Cloud Service is the first of its kind. Using OnMetal you create machine instances using OpenStack APIs but, instead of being provisioned a virtual machine, you are provisioned &lt;strong&gt;on physical hardware&lt;/strong&gt;. OnMetal servers are single-tenant, bare-metal servers provisioned via the OpenStack API and can be spun up as quickly as VMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once OnMetal is live, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to provision CoreOS instances on Rackspace&amp;rsquo;s OnMetalcloud. This combination gives you the ease of spinning up machines with the click of a mouse, the security of running CoreOS with automatic updates, and the raw horsepower of running on bare metal. Pretty impressive!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Virtual Machines vs. Containers</title>
      <link>http://danstroot.com/2014/05/05/virtual-machines-vs-containers</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://danstroot.com/2014/05/05/virtual-machines-vs-containers</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;lazy img-rounded img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=&#34; alt=&#34;Docker&#34; data-src=&#34;/assets/img/docker.png&#34; width=&#34;750&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three driving forces of infrastructure efficiency in a large, distributed environment were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data center consolidation &lt;em&gt;(KPI: How many DCs do you have?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Host virtualization &lt;em&gt;(KPI: what percentage of your servers are virtual?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cloud&amp;rdquo; in its various forms &lt;em&gt;(KPI: How many servers are you still running?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming you have been aggresive you may not have any data centers left.  You may be buying services rather than servers, and/or all of your remaining machines might be virtualized and hosted in someone else&amp;rsquo;s data center. Now what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;##Where is the next level of infrastructure efficiency going to come from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I think the next wave of infrastructure efficiency will be driven by Linux container technology (LinuX Containers = LXC). The LXC container approach does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; require a hypervisor - instead you run isolated &amp;ldquo;containers&amp;rdquo; on a Linux host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LXC provides operating system-level virtualization, but instead of creating a full-fledged virtual machine LXC containers leverage cgroups (control groups) to completely isolate application&amp;rsquo;s view of the operating environment, including process trees, network, user ids and mounted file systems. Cgroups are a Linux kernel feature to limit, account, and isolate resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, etc.) of process groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work was started by engineers at Google and in late 2007 it was merged into kernel version 2.6.24. LXC also relies on other kinds of namespace-isolation functionality, which have been developed and integrated into the mainline Linux kernel since then. It looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;lazy img-rounded img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=&#34; alt=&#34;LXC vs. Virtual Machines&#34; data-src=&#34;/assets/img/dockervsvm.png&#34; width=&#34;750&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;##Is LXC Technology Really Better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the major benefits of Linux Containers from my perspective:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;####Fast&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Runtime performance at near bare metal speeds (typically 97+ percent of bare metal).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management operations (boot, stop, start, reboot, etc.) in seconds or milliseconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;####Agile&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VM-like agility &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s still &amp;ldquo;virtualization&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With VMs we often touted our ability to ship a machine &amp;ldquo;over the wire&amp;rdquo; since a virtual machine is basically just a large file.  It also allows better business recovery scenarios where I can have a snapshot of my production machine(s) copied to a different datacenter at regular intervals. Guess what? LXC containers are an order of magnitude smaller!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers can essentially use the exact same containers as those deployed into production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;####Lightweight&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just enough Operating System (JeOS); include only what you need reducing image and container bloat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimal per container penalty which equates to greater density and hence greater returns on existing assets &amp;ndash; imagine packing 100s or 1000s of containers on a single host node!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;####Inexpensive&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open source &amp;ndash; free &amp;ndash; lower TCO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supported with out-of-the-box modern Linux kernels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LXC hosting likely to drive the next wave of cloud products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;####Ecosystem&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growing in popularity &amp;ndash; just checkout the google trends for docker or LXC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vibrant community and numerous 3rd party applications (1000s of prebuilt images on docker index and 100s of open source apps on github or other public sources).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;####Benchmarks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average boot time: LXC 1.5x faster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average reboot time: LXC 18.9x faster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LXC CPU growth 26x lower than VM (per machine)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LXC Memory group 3x lower than VM (per machine)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LXC images 3.2x smaller than VM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;##Summary&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next wave of server density is likely to be driven by LXC technology instead of traditional VM technology.  This technology may also increase further an organizations agility, developer productivity and even business continuity. However, LXC technology is not yet as mature or &amp;ldquo;manageable&amp;rdquo; as VM technology, but tools like Docker are developing quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sources:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Enterprise Search 2014</title>
      <link>http://danstroot.com/2014/03/14/enterprise-search-2014</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://danstroot.com/2014/03/14/enterprise-search-2014</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;lazy img-rounded img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=&#34; alt=&#34;Google Enterprise Search&#34; data-src=&#34;/assets/img/Google_Enterprise_Search.png&#34; width=&#34;750&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges in a large distributed enterprise is &amp;ldquo;finding stuff&amp;rdquo;.  Sure we call it collaboration, knowledge management, or any number of other sophisticated terms but often it boils down to just finding stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To compensate the organization reacts by saving multiple copies and versions of a file in many different locations: email, shared file systems, intranets, etc.  Of course this compounds the issue and drives the desire to save &amp;ldquo;my copy&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;somewhere where I can find it&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A CIO&amp;rsquo;s role is to figure out how to make this problem go away.  So we start with good solid information management concepts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need a taxonomy of our information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to understand our &amp;ldquo;golden copies&amp;rdquo;, or master repositories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need the information to be very easily searched and discovered by our employees - wherever they are. This problem encompasses:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time zones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geography and the associated latency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indexing/crawling many diverse data stores&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It needs to be so simple and easy that it naturally overcomes the employee&amp;rsquo;s desire save a personal copy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We must have mature data access and permissioning processes in place.  Unleashing search on corporate systems where permissions aren&amp;rsquo;t managed well is a huge risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even though these concepts are straightforward  they are not easy.  Many of us wished we could just &amp;ldquo;Google&amp;rdquo; our companies documents.  Google understands this and has made enterprise search a product for some time now - it was first released in 2002!  I was just taking a look at it recently and it has come a long way from where it started. Relevancy is the key however, and Google considers its relevancy calculation models to be a precious competitive differentiator and therefore keeps them opaque.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of us have tried to use Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s platform in the past but it was always a bit of a challenge to manage, and the results were a hodgepodge.  It has also come a very long way with Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s FAST search technology and in SharePoint 2013 there is a mature approach to deploying search.  This clarifies what had long been a confusing product line featuring many different kinds of search capability for SharePoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is encouraging to see the progress and competition in this space. Someday soon corporate document/information search may be as simple as we are accustomed to on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sources:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/enterprise/search/products/gsa.html&#34;&gt;Google Enterprise Search&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
