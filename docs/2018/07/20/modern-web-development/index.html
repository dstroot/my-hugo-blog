The pace of innovation has been relentless, and front-end developers are confronted with new frameworks, tools, and standards for “modern” web development <strong>constantly</strong>. Framework fatigue is real thing. Even the languages of the web (HTML, CSS, and ECMAScript) have gone through a major modernization effort (and the pace of change increased):<p><small></small><ul><li>HTML &gt; HTML5 &gt; HTML 5.2<li>CSS 3 &gt; CSS 4 + SCSS, PostCSS, autoprefixer, etc.<li>ECMAScript 5 (2009) &gt; ECMAScript 2015, ECMAScript 2016, ECMAScript 2017, ECMAScript 2018</ul><p><p>The positive aspects of all the &ldquo;churn&rdquo; in the web development ecosystem are some truly incredible innovations that have fundamentally changed web development to enable much richer, engaging, and performant web &ldquo;applications&rdquo;.<p>One of the best things to come along lately are <strong>progressive web applications</strong>. Progressive web apps are &ldquo;installable&rdquo; and provide user experiences that combine the best of the web and the best of apps. They are useful to users from the very first visit in a browser, no install required. They are <a href="https://danstroot.com/2013/12/31/responsive-design-vs.-mobile-first/">responsive</a> to screen size, pixel density and orientation. They can load quickly (even <em>without</em> an Internet connection), can have an icon on the home screen, and can run as an app with a top-level, full screen experience.<blockquote><p>By the way <strong>this</strong> blog is a progressive web app and has been for a couple years. Boom.</blockquote><h4 id="a-progressive-web-app-is">A Progressive Web App is:</h4><ul><li><strong>Progressive</strong> - Works for every user, regardless of browser choice because it&rsquo;s built with progressive enhancement as a core tenet.<li><strong>Responsive</strong> - Fits any form factor: desktop, mobile, tablet, and whatever is next.<li><strong>Fast</strong> - Responds quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling.<li><strong>Reliable</strong> - Enhanced with <strong>service workers</strong> to work offline or on low-quality networks.<li><strong>App-like</strong> - Feels like an app rather than a website. More like a natural app on the device, with an immersive user experience.<li><strong>Fresh</strong> - Always up-to-date thanks to the service worker update process.<li><strong>Safe</strong> - Served via HTTPS to prevent snooping and to ensure content hasn&rsquo;t been tampered with.<li><strong>Discoverable</strong> - Is identifiable as an &ldquo;application&rdquo; thanks to a W3C manifest and service worker registration scope, allowing search engines to find it.<li><strong>Engaging</strong> - Makes re-engagement easy through features like push notifications.<li><strong>Installable</strong> - Allows users to add apps they find most useful to their home screen on their phone <strong>without using an app store</strong>.<li><strong>Linkable</strong> - Easily share the application via URL, does not require complex installation.</ul><p>That is a lot to unpack. Let&rsquo;s start with the underlying technology that makes it possible.<h4 id="what-is-a-service-worker">What is a Service Worker?</h4><p>Rich offline experiences, periodic background syncs, push notifications — functionality that would normally require a native application are now part of the web-native experience. Service workers provide the technical foundation these features rely on.<p>A service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page, opening the door to features that don&rsquo;t need a web page or user interaction. Today, they already include features like push notifications and background sync. In the future, service workers might support other things like geofencing. A core feature is the ability to intercept and handle network requests, including programmatically managing a cache of responses. The reason this is such an exciting API is that it allows you to support offline experiences, giving developers complete control over the experience.<h4 id="why-tls-https-only">Why TLS/HTTPS only?</h4><p>Service workers give you powerful capabilities. For example you can hijack connections and fabricate responses. While you would use these powers for good (e.g. content caching, working offline), a man-in-the-middle might not. To avoid this, you can only register service workers on pages served over HTTPS, so we know the service worker the browser receives hasn&rsquo;t been tampered with during its journey through the network.<p>Your site will also rank lower in Google’s search results if it is not served via TLS, and browsers like Chrome are flagging websites that do not have a secure connection. TLS is definitely part of the &ldquo;modern&rdquo; web.<p>The <strong>not</strong> modern web:<p><img src="https://danstroot.com/img/no-TLS.png" alt="No TLS"><h4 id="so-how-do-you-build-a-progressive-tls-secured-web-application-br-that-gets-perfect-marks-small-lighthouse-qualys-and-securityheaders-com-small-br-over-a-weekend-br-and-deploy-it-for-free">So how do you build a progressive, TLS-secured, <strong>web application</strong><br>- that gets <strong>perfect</strong> marks <small>(Lighthouse, Qualys and Securityheaders.com</small>)<br>- over a <strong>weekend</strong><br>- and deploy it for <strong>free</strong>?</h4><p>You must stand on the shoulders of giants. Seriously. This project uses the &ldquo;giants&rdquo; of modern web development:<p><small></small><ul><li>React<li>Yarn<li>Babel<li>Webpack<li>node<li>SCSS<li>Prettier<li>Bootstrap<li>FontAwesome<li>autoprefixer<li>PostCSS<li>Etc.</ul><p><p>Given all the tools and complexity, it might take days just to be able to configure a development environment, <strong>or</strong> you can just install <code>create-react-app</code>. You are up and running in about 35 seconds with <strong>no build configuration</strong> work.<ul><li><code>yarn start</code> runs your app in interactive development mode<li><code>yarn test</code> runs your tests<li><code>yarn build</code> builds your app for production</ul><p>&ldquo;Yarn build&rdquo; is magical. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes (for cachebusting). By default, it also includes a service worker so that your app is a <strong>full progressive web app</strong> that loads from local cache on future visits.<p><strong>Voila! Your app is ready to be deployed.</strong><p>My app is very small at the moment. I required:<ul><li>react-router (for page routing)<li>6 react &ldquo;pages&rdquo; (mainly pure components)<li>8 react components <small>(presentational, dumb, pure, functional&hellip; pick your term)</small></ul><p>For styling I used:<ul><li>Bootstrap<li>FontAwesome</ul><p>It was built over the course of a weekend. I am not a graphic designer, so please excuse the design.<p>I deployed it using Google Firebase Hosting - deploying your app from a local directory to the web only takes one command. The real draw is that it&rsquo;s 100% free for my usage level - 1 GB of storage (huge in web terms), and 10 GB/month of data, plus a free SSL certificate!<h4 id="the-results-veritedatascience-com-https-veritedatascience-com">The Results (<a href="https://veritedatascience.com">veritedatascience.com</a>):</h4><p>👍 Full source is available on <a href="https://github.com/dstroot/react-vds">GitHub</a>.<p>Perfect Lighthouse scores:<p><img src="https://danstroot.com/img/Lighthouse_Report.png" alt="Lighthouse"><p>A+ Qualys Score:<p><img src="https://danstroot.com/img/SSL_Labs.png" alt="Qualys SSL Labs"><p>A+ Security Headers Score:<p><img src="https://danstroot.com/img/security_headers.png" alt="Security Headers"><h4 id="references">References</h4><p><span class="sources"><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/">Google: Progressive Web Apps</a><br><a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html">Google: HTTPS as a ranking signal</a><br><a href="https://firebase.google.com/pricing/">Firebase: Pricing</a><br></span></div></div><ul class="pagination"><li><a class="" href="https://danstroot.com/2018/10/03/hammer-factories/"><span class="icon-chevron-circle-left"></span> Previous Post</a><li><a class="" href="https://danstroot.com/2018/03/17/facebook-suspends-cambridge-analytica/">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next Post <span class="icon-chevron-circle-right"></span></a></ul><hr class="soften"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">!function(){if("localhost"!=window.location.hostname){var e=document.createElement("script");e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0;e.src="//danstroot.disqus.com/embed.js",(document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0]||document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0]).appendChild(e)}}()</script></div><script id="dsq-count-scr" src="//danstroot.disqus.com/count.js" async></script><script src="https://danstroot.com/js/loadjs.min.js"></script><script>loadjs(["https://danstroot.com/css/highlight/github.css","https://danstroot.com/js/highlight.pack.js"],{success:function(){hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()},error:function(o){console.log("file not found")}})</script><script>loadjs(["https://danstroot.com/js/service-worker-registration.js"],{error:function(o){console.log("file not found")}})</script>
