Sometimes there are branches and special cases to keep track of as you go. Procedures/checklists are frustrating because they’re focus-intensive yet require very little thought. They demand our full attention, but our attention isn’t rewarded with interesting problems or satisfying solutions – just another checkbox checked. Procedures like this are called a <strong>slog</strong>.<p>Slogs are ripe for automation. We know that a computer could do it better than we can, and with less tendency toward practical drift. However, automating slogs feels like an all-or-nothing proposition. Maybe we could write a script to handle step 2, or step 5, but that wouldn’t really make the procedure any less cumbersome. It would lead to a proliferation of single-purpose scripts with different conventions and expectations, and you’d still have to follow a documented multi-step procedure for using those scripts.<p>This <strong>perception of futility</strong> is the problem we really need to solve in order to escape from these manual slogs. Here&rsquo;s an approach that works. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;executable documentation&rdquo;.<p>Almost any slog can be turned into executable documentation. Executable documentation is a script that encodes the instructions of a slog, encapsulating each step in a function. For example we could write the following executable documentation script:<pre><code class="language-sh">#! /bin/sh

</code></pre><p>Notice this script <strong>doesn’t actually do any of the steps of the procedure</strong>! It feeds the user a step at a time and waits for them to complete each step manually. These scripts will have little logic, and make little use of variables. They can also have a .txt filename to ensure that people understand, that first of all, this is a set of instructions for how to do something, which also just so happens to be a valid shell script.<p>At first glance, it might not be obvious that this script provides any value, but the value is immense. First, these scripts actually do something: they allow storing and updating the <em>state</em> of a process. By having these scripts run in a shell rather than in your head, the current state is stored in a machine, not your brain.<ul><li>It’s now much less likely that you’ll lose your place and skip a step. This makes it easier to maintain focus on the actual work and power through the slog. You can even exit the script and it will tell you where you stopped.<li>Each step of the procedure is now encapsulated in a function, which makes it possible to replace the text in any given step with code that actually performs the action.<li>Over time, you’ll develop a library of useful steps, which will make future automation tasks more efficient.<li>It will lower the inhibition to automation - each run you can just automate one or two more steps.</ul><p>Executable documentation doesn’t initially save your team any manual effort. However, <strong>it lowers the activation energy for automating tasks</strong>, which allows the team to eliminate toil over time.<p>For example I have a process to reinstall the operating system on my personal laptop from scratch, based on a checklist. I&rsquo;d always wanted to automate it but it just seemed like such a daunting task that I never ended up doing it. The frequency of use didn&rsquo;t seem to warrant the effort.<p>Last time I turned the checklist into a script, telling me what to do at each step. Then, since I was scripting rather writing a document I also implemented the ones that are easy to automate. I planned to automate a few more items each time I ran the checklist, until it&rsquo;s fully automated. A funny thing happened though - after few runs I had autmated a large portion of the steps, and that motivated me to just knock it out and finish. This is the power of executable documentation.<p>Executable documentation as concept can be very broad - many producst are based around the idea of complex tasks &ldquo;as code&rdquo;.
