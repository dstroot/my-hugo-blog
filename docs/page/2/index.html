They were concerned that in the event of issues &ldquo;there would be no support&rdquo;. At the time they believed that commercial software from companies like IBM, Oracle, Microsoft and SAP was &ldquo;safer&rdquo; because there was a commercial entity that stood behind the products they sold and provided support.<h3 id="now-that-s-changing">Now that&rsquo;s changing</h3><p>Most technology leadership today recognizes that proprietary software is not safer than open source software. Basic metrics around the number of disclosed vulnerabilities and &ldquo;time to patch availability&rdquo; seem to give an edge to open source software at least being patched faster. Not only that but you have the option to inspect the code yourself, and patch it yourself - options that are simply not available with commercial, closed software. This causes a re-evaluation of the relationship of proprietary, commercial software to operating a safe and secure business. The recent Volkswagen scandal brings to light the broader question of how vulnerable we are to software that is beyond oversight. Today when we have software running critical systems like medical devices, transportation systems, elevators, and cars we are realizing this code <strong>must</strong> be open to inspection. This does not mean the code must be open source - only that the code must be available for inspection and oversight.</p><a href="https://danstroot.com/2015/10/03/proprietary-software-is-an-unsafe-building-material/">Read On <span class="icon-chevron-circle-right"></span></a><hr class="soften"></div><div class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://danstroot.com/2015/09/26/is-it-secure/">Is it Secure?</a></h1><span class="post-date">September 26, 2015 &middot; <span class="icon-clock-o"></span> 6 minute read</span><p><img src="https://danstroot.com/img/SmartCarLock.png" alt="Security"><p><em>Q</em>: Is it secure?<br><em>A</em>: No it is not.

For example the folks who created the Bootstrap UI framework created a bot called <a href="https://github/twbs/rorshach">rorshach</a> to perform sanity checks on pull requests. If the sanity check fails it leaves a nice informative comment, explaining the issue and how to fix it.<p></p><a href="https://danstroot.com/2015/09/06/why-automate-code-reviews/">Read On <span class="icon-chevron-circle-right"></span></a><hr class="soften"></div><div class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://danstroot.com/2015/06/15/fintech-startups-tug-the-industry-forward/">FinTech Startups Tug the Industry Forward</a></h1><span class="post-date">June 15, 2015 &middot; <span class="icon-clock-o"></span> 3 minute read</span><p><img src="https://danstroot.com/img/billguard.png" alt="FinTech"><p>Financial services companies are among the most highly regulated industries in the world. They also suffer from a trust issue. Trust is a key ingredient in making a financial services business viable. Why would I ever buy insurance, banking services or invest my savings via a company that I didn’t trust?<p>After the sub-prime debt crisis in 2008 it became clear that the financial services industry would need to rebuild it’s image. Companies would need to zealously rebuild their brands to aspire to become “trusted advisors”. From an IT standpoint it is crystal clear that client and corporate data must be guarded and protected to prevent any loss as well as minimize the potential for damage to an organization’s reputation. How to manage the risk and yet stay innovative?<p></p><a href="https://danstroot.com/2015/06/15/fintech-startups-tug-the-industry-forward/">Read On <span class="icon-chevron-circle-right"></span></a><hr class="soften"></div><div class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://danstroot.com/2015/05/25/the-new-new-microsoft/">The &#39;New&#39; New Microsoft</a></h1><span class="post-date">May 25, 2015 &middot; <span class="icon-clock-o"></span> 3 minute read</span><p><img src="https://danstroot.com/img/satya-nadella-microsoft-ceo.jpg" alt="Microsoft"><p>I&rsquo;ve been a fan of Microsoft during my whole technical career.
