Since I recently rebuilt this site and been using a variety of tools to test it I was excited to see how well the site scored. The UI is very nice but you have to opt-in to email to get your detailed report. I am definitely not a fan of that &ldquo;dark pattern&rdquo;.<p>Usually my go-to benchmark is the the venerable <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">Google PageSpeed Insights</a>. PageSpeed Insights is very clear about delivering actionable steps you can take to improve overall speed and performance. Not too long ago Google also added a mobile section to give you insight about your mobile page performance as well.<p>However I recently adopted Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse">Lighthouse</a> tool and found that to be exceptionally useful, particularly since it is service worker aware. As a result this site will now run even when the network connection is severed on your mobile device. (Service workers should be a separate article)<p></p><a class="" href="https://danstroot.com/2017/01/10/i-feel-the-need-for-speed/">Read On <span class="icon-chevron-circle-right"></span></a></div><hr class="soften"></div><div class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://danstroot.com/2016/11/16/if-you-are-in-san-francisco-go-visit-moma/">If you are in San Francisco go visit MOMA</a></h1><span class="post-date">November 16, 2016 &middot; <span class="icon-clock-o"></span> 1 minute read &middot; <a href="https://danstroot.com/2016/11/16/if-you-are-in-san-francisco-go-visit-moma/#disqus_thread">Comments</a><br></span><div class="post-content"><table><thead><tr><th><img src="https://danstroot.com/img/sfmoma.jpg" alt="San Francisco MOMA"><th>If you are in San Francisco go visit MOMA.

By all means stay home if you want, but don&rsquo;t bullshit yourself that you&rsquo;re not voting.

You trusted the reality it portrayed. You trusted in journalism and even believed the news was actually &ldquo;fair and balanced&rdquo;. Then technology destroyed the business model of traditional journalism. The news institutions of the 20th century, print newspapers, the evening broadcast news, the trusted anchorman, are but relics of the past.<p>We turned to the Internet, but then we all learned the hard way that we can’t trust the Internet. We no longer know what is real and what is fake. With everything now digital, and with excellent tools to edit audio, video, and photos, we have become skeptics. As soon as we see a viral video on YouTube we immediately say to ourselves “that’s fake”. Every magazine with a beautiful girl on the cover we think to ourselves “Photoshop”. When we read a blog post we think “spin”.<p></p><a class="" href="https://danstroot.com/2016/10/30/free-to-believe-anything/">Read On <span class="icon-chevron-circle-right"></span></a></div><hr class="soften"></div><ul class="pagination"><li><a classs="" href="https://danstroot.com/page/2/" aria-label="Previous"><span class="icon-chevron-circle-left"></span> Newer Posts</a><li><a classs="" href="https://danstroot.com/page/4/" aria-label="Next">&nbsp;&nbsp;Older Posts <span class="icon-chevron-circle-right"></span></a></ul></div></div><script id="dsq-count-scr" src="//danstroot.disqus.com/count.js" async></script><script src="https://danstroot.com/js/loadjs.min.js"></script><script>loadjs(["https://danstroot.com/css/highlight/github.css","https://danstroot.com/js/highlight.pack.js"],{success:function(){hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()},error:function(o){console.log("file not found")}})</script><script>loadjs(["https://danstroot.com/js/service-worker-registration.js"],{error:function(o){console.log("file not found")}})</script>
