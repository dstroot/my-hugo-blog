<p>Saw the new Microsoft Surface Studio this weekend at the Microsoft store at the South Coast Plaza. I thought the display is pretty mind blowing. I have gotten used to wide screen displays but somehow the resolution and format of the screen just feels right. The display floats in space and fills your field of vision.</p>

<p>The surface dial seems like it would be a gimmick but it isn&rsquo;t. It feels very natural particularly when zooming in and out. Tilting the display down and working right on top of it is spectacular. Way to go Microsoft - you hit it out of the park!</p>

    <p><img src="/img/comic.png" alt="Cognitive Bias" /></p>

<p>When I was growing up, when you read the paper, watched the news, saw a film or a picture, you inherently believed in it.  You trusted the reality it portrayed. You trusted in journalism and even believed the news was actually &ldquo;fair and balanced&rdquo;. If you heard someone say “Kennedy’s death was faked” you would disbelieve them because you saw the evidence yourself.</p>

<p>Then we all learned the hard way that we can’t trust the Internet. We no longer know what is real and what is fake.  With everything now digital, and with excellent tools to edit audio, video, and photos, we have become skeptics. As soon as we see a viral video on YouTube we immediately say to ourselves “that’s probably fake”. Every magazine with a beautiful girl on the cover we think to ourselves “Photoshop”. When we read a blog post we think “spin”.</p>

<p></p>

<p>We no longer trust the news or what we read on the Internet. We live in strange and interesting times because now people are free to believe whatever they want to believe by discounting anything they see that does not align with their beliefs.</p>

<p>In addition, the big internet platforms, through their algorithms, have become an eye of a needle which news and media must pass through, limiting the content a person sees to that which already conforms to their views. The Internet is becoming one big &ldquo;echo chamber&rdquo; which is designed to filter and shape the information someone sees based on previous searches, as well as information it might have about their location or preferences.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“More likely than not, you get your news from Facebook, forty-four per cent of US adults get news on the site, and 61% of millennials … if that doesn’t frighten you, you don’t know enough about Facebook’s algorithm. If you have a parent who’s a Trump supporter, they are seeing a completely different set of news items than you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Caleb Gardner, President Barack Obama’s former social media adviser</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Angela Merkel has joined a growing number of critics who have highlighted the dangers of receiving information that confirms an existing opinion or is recommended by people with similar ideas.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Algorithms, when they are not transparent, can lead to a distortion of our perception, they can shrink our expanse of information.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Merkel called the issue a “challenge not just for political parties but for society as a whole”. “Repeat a lie often enough and it becomes the truth”, is a law of propaganda often attributed to the Nazi Joseph Goebbels. Among psychologists this is known as the &ldquo;illusion of truth&rdquo; effect. Because we need to make quick judgements, we adopt mental shortcuts – heuristics. Relying on how often you&rsquo;ve heard something to judge how truthful something feels is a strategy we all use. If we are only shown the news and information we choose to see, we are all reinforcing our cognitive biases.</p>

<p>Are the UK&rsquo;s &ldquo;Brexit&rdquo; movement and the USA&rsquo;s Donald Trump just the beginning? Is our increasingly polarized country due going to get even worse because we are only fed the information we want to see, and conflicting information is filtered from view?  Isn&rsquo;t a a healthy democracy dependent on people being confronted by opposing ideas?</p>

        Proprietary Software is an Unsafe Building Material
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Sat, Oct 3, 2015</span>

    <p><img src="img/volkswagen.jpg" alt="Volkswagen" /></p>

<p>At one point in time I worked for an organization that banned the use of open source software.  They were concerned that in the event of issues &ldquo;there would be no support&rdquo;.  At the time they believed that commercial software from companies like IBM, Oracle, Microsoft and SAP was &ldquo;safer&rdquo; because there was a commercial entity that stood behind the products they sold and provided support.</p>

<h3 id="now-that-s-changing">Now that&rsquo;s changing</h3>

<p>Most technology leadership today recognizes that proprietary software is not safer than open source software. Basic metrics around the number of disclosed vulnerabilities and &ldquo;time to patch availability&rdquo; seem to give an edge to open source software at least being patched faster.  Not only that but you have the option to inspect the code yourself, and patch it yourself - options that are simply not available with commercial, closed software. This causes a re-evaluation of the relationship of proprietary, commercial software to operating a safe and secure business.

The recent Volkswagen scandal brings to light the broader question of how vulnerable we are to software that is beyond oversight.  Today when we have software running critical systems like medical devices, transportation systems, elevators, and cars we are realizing this code <strong>must</strong> be open to inspection. This does not mean the code must be open source - only that the code must be available for inspection and oversight.</p>

<p>For example, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for evaluating the risks of new devices and monitoring the safety and efficacy of those currently on market. The software on these devices performs life-sustaining functions such as cardiac pacing and defibrillation, drug delivery, and insulin administration.</p>

<p>However, the agency is unlikely to scrutinize the software operating on devices during any phase of the regulatory process unless a model that has already been surgically implanted repeatedly malfunctions or is recalled. Despite the crucial importance of these devices medical device software is considered the exclusive property of its manufacturers, meaning neither patients nor their doctors are permitted to access their source code or test its security.</p>

<h3 id="proprietary-software-puts-us-at-risk">Proprietary software puts us at risk</h3>

<p>A Columbia University professor, Eben Moglen, who founded the Software Freedom Law Center, has argued proprietary, and thus invisible, software puts us all at risk. He uses the analogy of being able to inspect an elevator&rsquo;s operating mechanical condition as a foundational principle for having &ldquo;safe&rdquo; elevators.  But isn&rsquo;t the software that operates  elevators necessary to inspect as well?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Proprietary software is an unsafe building material”<br>
 <em>- Eben Moglen, Law Professor, Columbia University</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can we have &ldquo;safe&rdquo; cars or medical devices when the software is a black box and we simply have to trust the manufacturers? The code in automobiles is tightly protected under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Last year, several groups sought to have the code made available for “good-faith testing, identifying, disclosing and fixing of malfunctions, security flaws or vulnerabilities”. In response, a group of automobile manufacturers said that opening the code to scrutiny could create “serious threats to safety and security.” Think about that for a moment.</p>

<p>When proprietary code inflicts harm, such as Volkswagen’s polluting cars, the creators of that code must be held accountable. It’s definitely time to start demanding appropriate transparency.</p>

        Is it Secure?

    <span class="post-date">Sat, Sep 26, 2015</span>

    <p><img src="img/SmartCarLock.png" alt="Security" /></p>

<p><em>Q</em>: Is it secure? <br>
<em>A</em>: No it is not. Security is never binary.</p>

<p><em>Q</em>: OK, how secure is it? <br>
<em>A</em>: It seems like you just asked that question.</p>

<p><em>Q</em>: No, the first question was if it&rsquo;s secure, the second question was how secure is it. <br>
<em>A</em>: Well now that wasn&rsquo;t even a question at all.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="there-is-no-such-thing-as-perfect-security">There is no such thing as perfect security</h2>

<p>Most information security practitioners do a poor job explaining the relative nature of security.  Secure relative to what? A bot that looks for un-patched systems? A determined hacker? A nation-state?</p>

<p>Security is a &ldquo;scale of difficulty&rdquo; – like mountain climbing. Everest was thought to be unclimbable until Sir Edmund Hillary did it.  Everest was finally tackled by a massive expedition with enormous resources. The 1953 expedition totaled over 400 people, including 362 porters, 20 Sherpa guides and 10,000 lbs of baggage.  It was analogous to a military assault.</p>

<p>Given enough time and resources <strong>any</strong> security can be defeated.  The main goal of security is to raise the time and resources required to an unreasonable level.  But how do you really know how secure something is?</p>

<p>Like mountain climbing, security can and should be rated/evaluated based on actual experience. Also like mountain climbing there are initial conditions that indicate a “tough climb” or an easy one.</p>

<h2 id="conditions-for-high-security-levels">Conditions for high security levels</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>The technology is widely deployed/adopted.</strong> Note that being widely deployed does NOT mean the technology is secure (Windows XP was widely deployed). It simply means that we are more likely to have lots of data about its security performance. The more opportunities and incentives for attack will give us more data, which increases our confidence of it&rsquo;s &ldquo;rating&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>The technology or system is attacked frequently with great intensity.</strong> Ideally because of being widely deployed, it would be used is places that expose it to attack. Ideally those attacks are unrelenting.  This also increases our data about its security performance.</li>
<li><strong>The technology is simple to install and configure.</strong> Many supposedly &ldquo;secure&rdquo; systems are dependent on how they are installed, or post-install &ldquo;hardening&rdquo;.  Systems and technologies must be &ldquo;secure by default&rdquo; when installed and easily installed properly by non-specialists.</li>
<li><strong>Open code base.</strong> An open code base allows for infinitely many sets of eyes to review the code, and infinitely many developers to fix any vulnerabilities found.  Open code bases do <strong>NOT</strong> mean the code is secure.  However, there are generally fewer issues, and when issues are found they are addressed faster. They also tend to be widely deployed and tend to be less complex to install and maintain.</li>
<li><strong>Bug Bounty Program</strong>. Public, open <a href="https://bugcrowd.com/list-of-bug-bounty-programs">Bug Bounty Programs</a> encourage vulnerability research in a responsible manner. As an economist by training I believe when the rewards for good behavior are there you tend to get good behavior. If not, only bad behavior is rewarded.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="conditions-for-low-security-levels">Conditions for low security levels</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Not widely deployed</strong> The less widely the technology is deployed and used the fewer opportunities we have to gather good data about it’s security profile.</li>
<li><strong>Not frequently attacked, or successful attacks are generally not disclosed.</strong> This goes hand in glove with the above point. One issue with vendor sofware used in specialized applications within companies is that successful attacks may not be recognized/known, and/or they may not be disclosed. This gives us low information quality about the actual security performance.</li>
<li><strong>Difficult to install and configure properly.</strong> ERP applications such as SAP are notoriously complex and difficult to install. The database has over 70,000 tables excluding Y and Z tables, the overall system takes days to setup by highly trained specialists. The attack surface is quite large. SAP may not be a good example because security is good by default and we rarely hear about successful breaches - but the risk in the complexity is real.</li>
<li><strong>Closed code base</strong> If you have to ask your vendor “is it secure?” then it’s not.  Security isn&rsquo;t something you can provide an answer to unless you&rsquo;re selling snake oil. If the vendor says: “It&rsquo;s secure. We did not put in any back doors. We audited the code ourselves. There are not any kernel level hacks, root kits, or otherwise. This has been tested against a variety of anti-virus scanners and none of them flagged anything. We&rsquo;re very good. Please, please trust us.” then you should know that they are telling you what you want, or need to hear. You could read the <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb457059.aspx">WinXP pamphlet</a> on security back when it was released and it had endless bullet points about how secure it was. It was probably the least secure software in the history of computing based on actual attacks after the fact.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="it-s-secure-until-it-s-not">It’s secure… until it’s not</h2>

<p>In the 1770s Joseph Bramah created a lock that was vastly superior to any the world ever seen. Bramah believed it was 100% theft-proof. Bramah was so confident in his design that he published a pamphlet detailing exactly how it worked and he put it in the window of his London storefront, and painted on it a challenge:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The artist who can make an instrument that will pick or open this lock shall receive 200 Guineas the moment it is produced.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then Jeremiah Chubb created the Chubb detector lock. The way Chubb’s lock worked was that if a lock picker tried to lift one of the tumblers up too high, a latching mechanism would trigger, causing the lock to seize up. When that happened, even the key wouldn’t open the lock. To reset the lock, the owner would have to put in a different key and rotate it in the opposite direction to reset the tumblers.</p>

<p>Thus, if lock owners went to unlock a chest, or a vault, or a front door, and found that their key didn’t work, they would know that someone had tried to get in—and that they had failed.</p>

<p>For 70 years, the names Chubb and Bramah meant “perfect security”.</p>

<p>In 1851, London was hosting The Great Exhibition—the first international exhibition of manufactured products. One of the attendees was A. C. Hobbs, an American locksmith. Back in the states, Hobbs had made a name for himself by showing bank managers that their locks could be easily picked, and convincing them to buy one of his. Hobbs was selling lots of locks.</p>

<p>On day one of the exhibition, Hobbs publicly announced that he would pick the Chubb detector lock — the one that stops working if you pick it incorrectly. It took Hobbs about 25 minutes. And the way Hobbs did it was to use the lock against itself.
He would pick it until he tripped the detector mechanism, causing the lock to seize up. That would give Hobbs information about how it worked, and then he would pick the lock in the opposite direction to reset the detector. He’d go back and forth firing and resetting the detector until the lock told him everything he needed to know about how to get it open.</p>

<p>But the Chubb detector lock was really just a warm up. The main event was the Bramah safety lock—the one with the challenge painted on it in gold lettering, which had been sitting Bramah’s storefront window for 70 years, unbeaten.</p>

<p>After working on the lock for about 52 hours over the course of fourteen days, Hobbs opened it.</p>

<p>Overnight, the feeling of perfect security had evaporated. And we have never gotten it back.</p>

        Why Automate Code Reviews?

    <blockquote>
<p>Ask a programmer to review 10 lines of code, they&rsquo;ll make 10 suggestions. Ask them to review 1,000 lines of code and they&rsquo;ll say &ldquo;it looks good!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many people have begun integrating bots into the GitHub ecosystem for code review. For example the folks who created the Bootstrap UI framework created a bot called <a href="https://github/twbs/rorshach">rorshach</a> to perform sanity checks on pull requests. If the sanity check fails it leaves a nice informative comment, explaining the issue and how to fix it.</p>

<p>There is another example at <a href="https://betterdiff.com/">BetterDiff</a>. The idea there is that instead of having humans go through and give cursory reviews, you have a round of automated review by bots (using normal, industry-standard tooling) and it comments on the pull request just like a reviewer would.</p>

<p>Pretty soon I expect to see &ldquo;when tests pass, and code reviews pass, then go ahead and merge the code&rdquo; bots.</p>

        Fintech Startups Tug the Industy Forward

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Mon, Jun 15, 2015</span>

    <p><img class="lazy img-rounded img-responsive" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" alt="FinTech" data-src="/assets/img/billguard.png" width="750"></p>

<p>Financial services companies are among the most highly regulated industries in the world.  They also suffer from a trust issue.  Trust is a key ingredient in making a financial services business viable. Why would I ever buy insurance, banking services or invest my savings via a company that I didn’t trust?</p>

<p>After the sub-prime debt crisis in 2008 it became clear that the financial services industry would need to rebuild it’s image. Companies would need to zealously rebuild their brands to aspire to become “trusted advisors”. From an IT standpoint it is crystal clear that client and corporate data must be guarded and protected to prevent any loss as well as minimize the potential for damage to an organization’s reputation. How to manage the risk and yet stay innovative?</p>

<p></p>

<p>The response by some financial services companies is to stick their head in the sand and avoid &ldquo;the cloud&rdquo;, open source technologies, and try to make their networks ever more restrictive. This backfires in several ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>Their economics are always working against them relative to more open competitors, which they justify by convincing themselves that they are more secure and it&rsquo;s &ldquo;worth it&rdquo;. However managed properly their competitors are just as secure.</li>
<li>Their employees skills go stale. Since IT personnel cost so much the result is  mismanging a key resource.</li>
<li>By outsourcing aspects of their security to companies like Oracle, Microsoft and IBM they convince themselves they are more secure.  Does anyone know how many vulnerabilities there have been in the .NET framework <a href="http://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-26/product_id-2002/Microsoft-.net-Framework.html">over the years</a>?</li>
<li>Employees will begin actively circumventing security when it impedes their ability to do their job. I&rsquo;ve met employees who use their personal laptops on open Wi-Fi because they tell me they can&rsquo;t work on their corporate laptop and network because it is so locked down.<br /></li>
</ol>

<p>What&rsquo;s even worse than the problems listed above is the <strong>market never stands still</strong>.  Your future competitors are today&rsquo;s startups. FinTech companies are improving payment processes, reducing fraud, saving users money, promoting financial planning and responsibility, improving lending, and ultimately moving a giant, cautious industry forward.</p>

<p>If we look at a recent article in Forbes that profiles <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ilyapozin/2014/12/14/15-fintech-startups-to-watch-in-2015/">15 FinTech startups to watch in 2015</a> we can then also peek at the technologies they are using as see where the future lies with financial services:</p>

</ul>

<p>What can we take away from this list?</p>

<ol>
<li>Fintech startups are not afraid of open source.</li>
<li>Fintech startups are taking advantange of cloud economics and scale (AWS, Rackspace and Azure as examples).</li>
<li>Fintech startups are not afraid of using other &ldquo;startup&rdquo; services.</li>
<li>Yet they also must be solving the security issue as well - what the most tenuous point in any companies lifespan and the one where trust matters the most?  The startup phase.<br /></li>
</ol>

<p>What will this mean for incumbent companies that refuse to change? Maybe in the future they will be both secure and irrelevant.  Or worse, maybe just irrelevant.</p>

<p>The lives of people in poor countries will improve faster in the next 15 years than <strong>at any other time in history</strong>. And their lives will improve more than anyone else&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><em>- 2015 Gates Annual Letter</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are four pillars to accomplish this mission:</p>

<ol>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Farming</li>
<li>Banking</li>
<li>Education</li>
</ol>

<p>My daughter and I spent 10 days traveling in Uganda several years ago with our friends Jeff Jensen and his daughter Caroline.  We traveled fairly extensively and visited a number of charitable organizations in and around Kampala and Gulu.  It&rsquo;s hard to appreciate how far ahead we are economically unless you experience it first hand.</p>

<p>One of the places we visited was <a href="http://www.krochetkids.org/">Krochet Kids</a> in Gulu. They are the largest employer of women in the area. They provide job training, a fair wage to lift them and their families out of poverty, and a positive family-oriented environment. On a side note you can buy their products in Nordstrom!  This picture is &ldquo;the factory&rdquo; on the day we visited:</p>

<p><img class="lazy img-rounded img-responsive" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" alt="Open Data" data-src="/assets/img/krochet-kids.jpg" width="750"></p>

<p>As you can see the women get to sit in the shade of large trees, children are welcome, and they are encouraged to socialize as they work. The women I met were very happy and grateful for the opportunity.  However we found out that when the women got paid (cash - they do not have bank accounts) their husbands would take the money.  Some husbands would go drinking or find other ways to spend the money unwisely. The women were not empowered culturally to resist.</p>

<p>The founders of Krochet Kids decided they needed to find a way to create a type of bank where the women could protect their wages. If they didn&rsquo;t bring home cash their husbands would not have access to it. The key was to find a way to allow them to save money in an account, and also possibly loan each other money.  The Village Savings and Loans Association (VSLA) was born. Currently on any given week there is roughly $10,000 being saved in the VSLA. The VSLA now offers small loans to women in the group and collects and divides any interest incurred.</p>

<p>What Krochet Kids discovered was that in some ways the most valuable service they provided was not &ldquo;a job&rdquo; but rather training and mentorship on personal budgeting, savings, loans and business management topics.  One of their stated goals is now:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To equip the women of Northern Uganda with the financial assets and knowledge to enter into the local economy and thereby end their dependence on humanitarian aid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When reading this year&rsquo;s Gates Letter Mobile Banking is one of the four pillars of the fifteen year plan. I have seen firsthand how empowering this can be.</p>

        Keep it Simple... UX Design
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Tue, Jan 13, 2015</span>

    <p><img class="lazy img-rounded img-responsive" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" alt="Open Data" data-src="/assets/img/iron_man.png" width="750"></p>

<p>Having done some user interface work over the break I discovered that my design approach was basically to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Look around the web for things that I liked and then proceed to &lsquo;borrow&rsquo; their aesthetic.</li>
<li>Leverage UX/UI frameworks such as <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> or <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a>.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Combining a framework with something I think &ldquo;looks cool&rdquo; is a quick win.  I can get something created quickly that has an incredible amount of time and effort already baked in to making it usable, responsive and approachable.  Given the very wide of use of these frameworks I suspect many others work this way, but also since users are used to seeing many sites built with these frameworks it creates sense of familiarity.</p>

<p>I am definitely not a designer and usually this is a cerebral as I get when it comes to UX/UI design work but I decide to step back and think about what we were trying accomplish. For example what are the base principles that could guide us?  I found some good material from <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/">Nielsen Norman Group</a> that I want to share (I hope it&rsquo;s OK).</p>

<p>Nielsen&rsquo;s 10 Heuristic Design Principles:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>####VISIBILITY OF SYSTEM STATUS
The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.
####MATCH BETWEEN SYSTEM AND THE REAL WORLD
The system should speak the users&rsquo; language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.
####USER CONTROL AND FREEDOM
Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked &ldquo;emergency exit&rdquo; to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.
####CONSISTENCY AND STANDARDS
Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.
####ERROR PREVENTION
Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.
####RECOGNITION RATHER THAN RECALL
Minimize the user&rsquo;s memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.
####FLEXIBILITY AND EFFICIENCY OF USE
Accelerators &ndash; unseen by the novice user &ndash; may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.
####AESTHETIC AND MINIMALIST DESIGN
Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.
####HELP USERS RECOGNIZE, DIAGNOSE, AND RECOVER FROM ERRORS
Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.
####HELP AND DOCUMENTATION
Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user&rsquo;s task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The main area that I struggle with is keeping it simple and minimal.  I tend to want to create &ldquo;Tony Stark&rdquo; approved interfaces, yet in the real world I strongly prefer clean simplicity. Check out this example from the retailer Victoria Beckham:</p>

<p><img class="lazy img-rounded img-responsive" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" alt="Open Data" data-src="/assets/img/VICTORIA_BECKHAM.png" width="750"></p>

<p>The product is front and center and draws your eye.  The navigation is minimal.  The buying options are as limited as possible, you can only choose your size.  Yet there is nothing missing - I can get more details if I want, or a size guide if needed.  To me, this is oustanding UI/UX.  It is clean, simple and usable, and it highlights the product and only the product. What is your ideal UI/UX?</p>

        President Obama&#39;s Plan for a Free and Open Internet
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Mon, Nov 10, 2014</span>

    <p><img class="lazy img-rounded img-responsive" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" alt="Open Data" data-src="/assets/img/obama_internet.png" width="750"></p>

<p>Today President Barack Obama has come out in favor of net neutrality in very public way.  He lays out in no uncertain terms that he believes no cable company or access provider should be able to put limits on access to the Internet. In addition, he’s suggesting that the FCC recognizes access to the Internet as a basic utility, and something that Americans have a basic right to. This means no blocking, no throttling, more transparency and no paid prioritization.
</p>

<p>Here are the four principles quoted directly:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>No blocking.</strong> If a consumer requests access to a website or service, and the content is legal, your ISP should not be permitted to block it. That way, every player — not just those commercially affiliated with an ISP — gets a fair shot at your business.</li>
<li><strong>No throttling.</strong> Nor should ISPs be able to intentionally slow down some content or speed up others — through a process often called “throttling” — based on the type of service or your ISP’s preferences.</li>
<li><strong>Increased transparency.</strong> The connection between consumers and ISPs — the so-called “last mile” — is not the only place some sites might get special treatment. So, I am also asking the FCC to make full use of the transparency authorities the court recently upheld, and if necessary to apply net neutrality rules to points of interconnection between the ISP and the rest of the Internet.</li>
<li><strong>No paid prioritization.</strong> Simply put: No service should be stuck in a “slow lane” because it does not pay a fee. That kind of gatekeeping would undermine the level playing field essential to the Internet’s growth. So, as I have before, I am asking for an explicit ban on paid prioritization and any other restriction that has a similar effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you are on the &ldquo;red team&rdquo; or the &ldquo;blue team&rdquo; - this is a noble goal and one I hope everyone supports. An open Internet benefits us all in a myriad of ways and allows a free and open exchange of ideas across society. I&rsquo;d urge you to read <a href="http://www.raptitude.com/2014/11/the-gift/">The Greatest Gift We Ever Had</a>.  Key quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;honest, inclusive conversation across a society will reliably lead to equality and higher quality of life, in any place it is allowed to happen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>###My Thoughts:
* There is one principle missing: <strong>No Content Modification.</strong> ISPs should not be allowed to modify any of the content they transport.  This prevents them from injecting beacons, tracking code, advertising, etc. into web content that they are entrusted to deliver.  This is happening and it needs to be stopped.
* &ldquo;Government Regulation&rdquo; is known to increase costs, and potentially reduce growth and innovation.  All things being equal I am in favor of less regulation rather than more regulation.  We need to tread carefully as we seek to increase regulation to protect openness (bit of an oxymoron isn&rsquo;t it?).
* We have to think carefully about the paid access issue. Does &ldquo;no slow lanes&rdquo; also mean &ldquo;No Fast Lanes&rdquo;?  What if I want an ISP to provide a service where I get premium access to YouTube content, or Netflix content?  Should that be illegal?
* It is not a requirement that ISPs block unlawful content, rather it is a prohibition on blocking lawful content. But a strong enough prohibition on blocking lawful content (e.g., one which provides consequences whenever lawful content is blocked, even if the intent was to block unlawful content and the lawful content just got caught up in the filter) actually reduces the incentive for ISPs to attempt to identify and block unlawful content, since attempting to do so but making a misidentification in the process can result in penalties.  In other words access to child pornography, terrorist information, and illicit drugs could actually increase as a result (i.e. &ldquo;the law of unintended consequences&rdquo;).</p>

<p>###Update:</p>

<p>As someone who considers himself a Republican It saddens me that this issue has become so polarized along party lines.</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>&quot;Net Neutrality&quot; is Obamacare for the Internet; the Internet should not operate at the speed of government.</p>&mdash; Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) <a href="https://twitter.com/SenTedCruz/status/531834493922189313">November 10, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The only similarity to the Affordable Care Act is that Obama supports it. There may be a rational, reasoned argument against Net Neutrality, but Republicans aren’t making it, and neither are the cable companies or cellular providers.</p>

<p>The main thrust seems to be &ldquo;Government regulation of the Internet will be bad.&rdquo;  And yet, we seem to have no issues regulating banks, power utilities, telephone companies and other utilities.  The other argument seems to be the &ldquo;slippery slope&rdquo; argument - by introducing goverment regulation it is easy to envision that we will soon start regulating <strong>content</strong>.  However, with our country&rsquo;s foundation on free speech I find that argument quite a stretch and exactly the opposite of Obama&rsquo;s first principle: &ldquo;No Blocking&rdquo;.</p>

        USA&#39;s Digital Playbook
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Tue, Aug 12, 2014</span>

    <p><img class="lazy img-rounded img-responsive" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" alt="Open Data" data-src="/assets/img/USDS_Playbook.png" width="750"></p>

<p>The White House announced on Monday, August 11th 2014, that it is formally launching a new U.S. Digital Service and that it has hired Mikey Dickerson to lead it.  Mickey Dickerson is an engineer widely credited with playing a central role in salvaging HealthCare.gov. The idea behind the USDS is institutionalizing the approach that saved the US health care website.
</p>

<p>USDS is launching with a pair of foundational texts: <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/">A Digital Services Playbook</a> with 13 key &lsquo;plays&rsquo;&rdquo; for implementing digital government and a <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/playbook/blob/gh-pages/_includes/techfar-online.md">TechFAR Handbook</a> to advise agencies on how to take a more agile approach to federal contracting and procurement.</p>

<p>As I read through the digital playbook I was struck by the fact that it&rsquo;s full of common sense, elegantly designed, has clear navigation, and is responsive to any device you choose to view it upon. In other words it is nothing like any official government documentation I have ever seen before.  Oh, and it&rsquo;s hosted on GitHub.</p>

<p>The playbook is basically applied common sense and smart best practices from silicon valley.  In other words &ldquo;it works&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s the same playbook employed by web giants like Google, Facebook and Twitter and nearly all web startups.</p>

<p>As a CIO I think the playbook should really be <strong>everyone&rsquo;s</strong> playbook - it&rsquo;s very good and worth a read.</p>

<h2 id="let-s-talk-about-open-government-first">Let&rsquo;s Talk About Open Government First</h2>

<p>President Barack Obama, on his first day in office in 2009, signed an executive order stating that all government information that did not have to be kept secret for security or privacy reasons should be made public. The administration also launched the Open Data Initiative to publish government data and the <a href="http://www.data.gov/">data.gov</a> website to distribute the data.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My Administration is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in Government. We will work together to ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration. Openness will strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness in Government.</p>

<p>_- <a href="http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/news/20090121/2009_transparency_memo.pdf">President Barack Obama, January 21, 2009</a>_</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Huge strides have been made by the &ldquo;Open Government&rdquo; movement. Today:</p>

<ul>
<li>Citizens and government leaders alike now expect government data to be accessible, transparent and machine-readable.</li>
<li>Further, 67.9 percent of people surveyed believe that “Government data is the property of taxpayers and should be free to all citizens.”</li>
<li>By a margin of three to one people said they are more likely to vote for politicians who champion data transparency.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="it-s-progressed-far-quicker-than-we-expected">It&rsquo;s progressed far quicker than we expected</h3>

<ol>
<li>The United States Government maintains its <a href="https://github.com/project-open-data/project-open-data.github.io">Open Data Policy</a> on GitHub! Anyone can fork the policy, edit it, and submit a pull request to have their edits adopted in a fully open process, exactly like creating open source software.</li>
<li>Open data is a global movement. More than 40 countries — from every region of the world and at every stage of development — have established open data initiatives. These nations are opening up all kinds of data sets to promote economic development, spark innovation, and find ways to make government operate better. India has released 3,500 data
sets, mostly of agricultural information. Singapore has shared 8,600 data sets
from 60 public agencies, and just this year Australian budget data was made available in machine-readable form.</li>
<li>The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has published a set of standards (<a href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:37120:ed-1:v1:en">ISO 37120</a>) that specifies the relevant metrics for city services and quality of life. This will let researchers and citizens evaluate any city based on a uniform set of metrics. Furthermore, ISO 37120 confirms and accelerates the momentum of the open data movement and now provides a common framework within which all cities can participate. It is a gateway to smarter cities (and citizens).</li>
<li>Cities have embraced the open government movement and opened up their data to the public. Here are some examples:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://performance.lacity.org/">Los Angeles City Metrics</a> and <a href="https://data.lacity.org/">DataLA (LA Data Portal)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://nycopendata.socrata.com/">New York City Open Data Portal</a></li>
<li><a href="https://data.cityofboston.gov/">City of Boston Data Portal</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="it-has-a-far-larger-economic-potential-than-we-expected">It has a far larger economic potential than we expected</h3>

<ul>
<li>The benefits of open data are self-reinforcing: they increase as individuals access the data and help to improve the accuracy and detail of the information available. As people see the value in the data they will use it to create innovation and growth.  It also drives trust as government leaders and officials can now be more easily measured and held accountable.</li>
<li>A <a href="http://www.omidyar.com/sites/default/files/file_archive/insights/ON%20Report_061114_FNL.pdf">report</a> by Lateral Economics and the Omidyar Network finds that, by implementing open data policies, G20 countries could increase their cumulative GDP by $13 trillion over the next five years, because open data attracts private infrastructure investment, creates jobs, strengthens tax systems, and fights corruption.</li>
<li>A report by <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/open_data_unlocking_innovation_and_performance_with_liquid_information">McKinsey &amp; Co.</a>  suggests that seven sectors alone could generate more than $3 trillion a year in additional value as a result of open data, which is already giving rise to hundreds of entrepreneurial businesses and helping established companies to segment markets, define new products and services, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operations.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-few-words-about-open-science">A Few Words About Open Science</h2>

<p>Science can be broadly described as collecting, analyzing, publishing, reanalyzing, critiquing, and reusing data. Interestingly, the open data movement in science predates the Internet. The concept of open access to scientific data was institutionally established in the mid-20th century when the International Council of Scientific Unions (now the International Council for Science) established several World Data Centers to minimize the risk of data loss and to maximize data accessibility, further recommending in <strong>1955</strong> that data be made available in machine-readable form. <a href="http://www.icsu-wds.org/organization">1</a></p>

<p>Much like open government, there are some commonly held beliefs about making scientific data publicly available:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Data belongs to the human race&rdquo;. Typical examples are genomes, data on organisms, medical science, and environmental data.</li>
<li>Open data enables open peer review, which in turn creates better science.</li>
<li>In scientific research, the rate of discovery is accelerated by better access to data.</li>
<li>Sponsors of research do not get full value unless the resulting data is made publicly available. Or, put another way, trust in sponsored research increases.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a result has been a <a href="http://thecostofknowledge.com/">strong backlash</a> to the current publishing practices and keeping scientific data behind paywalls.  To date nearly fifteen thousand scientists have signed a petition for the right of authors to achieve easily accessible distribution of their work.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s clear that that the concepts of open data benefit science, and the platforms we discuss below could be used to further the goals of open science.</p>

<h2 id="what-open-data-looks-like">What Open Data Looks Like</h2>

<p>Goals, metrics and discoveries must be transparent.  Here are examples from city data:</p>

<p><img class="lazy img-rounded img-responsive" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" alt="Goals" data-src="/assets/img/goals.png" width="750"></p>

<p><img class="lazy img-rounded img-responsive" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" alt="Goals" data-src="/assets/img/goals_metric.png" width="750"></p>

<p><img class="lazy img-rounded img-responsive" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" alt="Open Data" data-src="/assets/img/open_data.png" width="750"></p>

<p>Datasets supporting the goals, metrics and discoveries must be publicly available, along with other supporting data:</p>

<p><img class="lazy img-rounded img-responsive" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" alt="Data Catalog" data-src="/assets/img/data_catalog.png" width="750"></p>

<p>Platforms have sprung up to support the open government movement. <a href="http://www.socrata.com/">Socrata</a> appears to have market leadership in this space and has a very complete vision of what an open data platform looks like:</p>

<p><img class="lazy img-rounded img-responsive" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" alt="Socrata" data-src="/assets/img/socrata.png" width="750"></p>

<h2 id="the-open-data-corporation">The &ldquo;Open Data&rdquo; Corporation</h2>

<p>Open data is fast becoming a defining theme for business.</p>

<ul>
<li>We all know that data is essential for management decision-making and strategic insight.</li>
<li>Enlightened organizations understand that data is a strategic corporate asset and foundational to operational excellence.</li>
<li>Companies understand that internal clarity and efficiency requires &ldquo;a single version of the truth&rdquo;, and making data accessible is one of the first steps on this journey.</li>
<li>Integrated data from open sources and social media now allows a 360-degree view of customers, suppliers, products and markets and can generate new product ideas.</li>
</ul>

<p>But how many companies today are committed to open data across the enterprise, or know how to implement an open data initiative? Many organizations still behave as if data is a by-product of the systems that generate and use it, and nothing more.  The data stays locked into those systems and is inaccessible to those without a seat license.</p>

<p>Some organizations are &ldquo;shy&rdquo; about sharing actual business performance data openly with their employees. This breeds mistrust of course.  Some departments may not like openly sharing their data and metrics (what <em>is</em> the average time to resolve a customer complaint?). Some people like to hoard data, giving them power in the organization.</p>

<p>The idea that unlocking value requires open data, and open data deserves deliberate investment, resources, headcount, and technology support – just like a company’s other corporate assets – is starting to sound like common sense.</p>

<h4 id="why-not-have-an-enterprise-architecture-that-is-defined-by-data-instead-of-services">Why not have an enterprise architecture that is defined by <strong>data</strong> instead of <strong>services</strong>?</h4>

<p>In the past we have made several runs at enterprise architectures that were defined by services.  Best known is &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">Service Oriented Architecture</a>&rdquo; (SOA) which defined services that performed self-contained units of functionality, such as retrieving a customer record.  Services could then be combined and reused to perform business processes.</p>

<p>Some challenges of this approach:</p>

<ul>
<li>It went against the trend towards buying sofware instead of building it - if I buy SAP what services does it expose?  Do I have to build my own services <em>on top of SAP</em>? If so, what happens when I upgrade SAP and the data model changes?</li>
<li>Service discovery and reuse are hard problems in large environments, and it is also hard to maintain coherence and integrity of services. Metadata is necessary, like a catalogue, to perform discovery of services.</li>
<li>Processes that require managing application or process &ldquo;state&rdquo; are difficult to build.</li>
<li>Initially there were many technical ways to build services - starting with Remote Procedure Calls (RPC), then Java Business Integration (JBI), Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and data distribution service (DDS) and Simple Object Oriented Protocol (SOAP), which led us to concept of &ldquo;Web Services&rdquo; and the Web Services Description Language (WSDL). In short, a mess.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why not invert the concept of services and start with data? Instead of starting with the concept of a customer object and then designing services to update the object lets just buy some licenses of <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/">Salesforce.com</a>.  Now I have all the &ldquo;services&rdquo; I need to manage customer data.  The challenge is how do I share that data with other applications in the company, or people without Salesforce seat licenses?</p>

<p>Today on the web we generally use the REST (REpresentational State Transfer) design pattern. This means that the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations are specified by using HTTP methods to create APIs.  We can consume these APIs in applications or websites with technologies like AJAX.  A catalog and metadata is necessary, and this catalog must be usable by both humans and machines.</p>

<p>In the example above we would use the <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api_rest/">Salesforce REST API</a>.  If we were to take other datasets in the company, particularly those without REST APIs, and make them available in an online catalog like <a href="http://www.socrata.com/">Socrata&rsquo;s</a> we then get a REST API &ldquo;built-in&rdquo;. Now the data is both discoverable and usable anywhere in the organization!</p>

<p>It has been notoriously difficult to share and integrate data across an enterpise and using a data-centric approach and REST APIs may be an answer.</p>

<h4 id="leaders-are-more-trusted">Leaders are more trusted</h4>

<p>We know people are more likely to vote for politicians who who champion data transparency, but guess what? People are also more like to trust and follow leaders who who champion data transparency inside their organizations.</p>

<h4 id="organizations-perform-better">Organizations perform better</h4>

<p>Open data can, and should be, linked to strategic goals.  Are your organizations goals transparent?  Are the metrics supporting those goals transparent?  Is the actual data of the performance of the company against those goals shared openly across the firm?</p>

<p>Too many organizations create grandiose plans and goals that make for wonderful slideware.  When it comes to tying them to hard metrics and then rigourously and publicly sharing progress many fall short.  This means inside the organization the &ldquo;chaos of competing priorities&rdquo; continues and the company lacks focus and ultimately performance.</p>

<h4 id="value-is-unlocked">Value is unlocked</h4>

<ul>
<li>Open data can bring fresh insights into how companies operate and help management identify and eliminate &ldquo;the sand in the gears&rdquo; and other barriers to productivity.</li>
<li>Companies can choose to share proprietary data to create benchmarks that can improve overall industry performance.</li>
<li>Using open data, such as customer discussions on social media, companies can refine product requirements and create new products and services.</li>
<li>Companies can even consider ways in which to monetize the value of their data.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="a-few-words-about-information-security">A few words about information security</h3>

<p>Yes, &ldquo;open data&rdquo; sounds like it runs counter to everything we have been taught about information security and the principle of &ldquo;least priviledge&rdquo;. To be clear, there is information in an organization addressed by privacy laws, HIPAA, PCI and various and sundry other laws and regulations. This data must (of course) be protected as prescribed - even so, having a record of the datasets involved and who &ldquo;owns&rdquo; them is actually useful for both open data purposes (because it makes the fact we have the data, and who owns it, visible even if the dataset itself is not exposed) as well as information security requirements - security begins with information ownership and knowing who can grant/revoke access to sensitive information.</p>

<p>Lets also keep things in perspective - the vast majority of data in most organizations is simply &ldquo;internal data&rdquo; and is not confidential or sensitive. Yet it is information that people need to perform their jobs and often they struggle to find it, or use stale data, because they just don&rsquo;t know where to go or who to contact for the information - sand in the gears of daily operations.</p>

<p>Finally, REST API&rsquo;s are able to be secured, usually via a key or OAuth athentication strategy so that open data doesn&rsquo;t have to mean &ldquo;openly accessible&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Think about how open data could apply to your business:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you know what the key operational metrics of your company are?</li>
<li>How transparent are those metrics?</li>
<li>Do you know which datasets support those metrics?</li>
<li>Do you know all the data that is available in your company? Is there a catalog of datasets?</li>
<li>Do you know who is <em>responsible</em> for the data (i.e. the data owner or steward)?</li>
<li>How accessible is the data?</li>
<li>Can data be explicitly shared, and when shared, can the dataset owner/publisher specify the role for each grantee - editor, viewer, etc.?</li>
<li>If data cannot be shared do we at least know who &ldquo;owns&rdquo; or is responsible for it?</li>
<li>Is it available for download in any reasonable format needed?<br /></li>
<li>Is it accessible via an API so your internal developers can work with it?</li>
<li>Can your organization consume open data from outside sources easily and make it available across the company?</li>
</ul>

        CoreOS: thousands of machines and millions of Docker containers... no hypervisor needed.
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Sun, Jun 29, 2014</span>

    <p><img class="lazy img-rounded img-responsive" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" alt="CoreOS" data-src="/assets/img/coreos-logo.png" width="594"></p>

<p>I have been playing around with CoreOS to get a sense of how everything works. The vision of this project is incredible.</p>

<p>CoreOS describes itself as <em>&ldquo;a new Linux distribution that has been re-architected to provide features needed to run modern infrastructure stacks. The strategies and architectures that influence CoreOS allow companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter to run their services at scale with high resilience.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>CoreOS displaces hypervisors and machine virtualization in favor of Docker and Linux containers.  CoreOS uses Linux containers to manage your services at a high level of abstraction. A single service&rsquo;s code and all dependencies are packaged within a container that can be run on one or many CoreOS machines.</p>

<p>Clustering works across platforms, meaning there is no cloud vendor lock-in. For example, CoreOS runs on Amazon EC2, Rackspace, QEMU/KVM, VMware and OpenStack and your own hardware. Running a single CoreOS cluster on multiple different clouds or cloud + bare metal is supported and encouraged. This lack of lock-in is the reason why I have supported OpenStack and CoreOS takes this even further.
</p>

<h4 id="we-begin-with-concept-of-a-large-fleet-of-machines-that-start-and-remain-exactly-consistent-at-the-os-level">We begin with concept of a large fleet of machines that start (and remain) exactly consistent at the OS level.</h4>

<ul>
<li>First, think of CoreOS somewhat like you might think of a hypervisor today.  It is the first layer you put down on bare metal, or as a virtual machine in a cloud. It is a &ldquo;bare minimum&rdquo; Linux-based OS that supports Linux LXC containers.</li>
<li>It is designed to run as a large fleet (hive?) of machines. It includes built-in primitives such as distributed locking and master election, plus key services necessary to manage the fleet of machines. (more on this later).</li>
<li>It is meant to always be consistent across machines.

<ul>
<li>CoreOS utilizes an active/passive dual-partition scheme to update the OS as a <em>single unit</em> instead of <em>package by package</em>.<br /></li>
<li>CoreOS also has the tenant of <strong>automatically</strong> updating itself. This avoids the issue of inconsistent state from machine to machine within a large cluster. Conceptually this is roughly like a self-updating hypervisor.</li>
<li>Each machine has to acquire and hold a reboot lock before it is allowed to reboot. The reboot lock is held until the machine releases it after a successful update. The number of machines allowed to reboot simultaneously is configurable. The main goal to allow for an update to be applied to a fleet quickly, without impacting capacity for the services running on the cluster.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="next-we-have-the-concept-that-the-fleet-of-machines-is-simply-a-single-pool-of-compute-resources">Next, we have the concept that the fleet of machines is simply a single pool of compute resources.</h4>

<ul>
<li>You treat your CoreOS cluster as if it has a single, shared init system - one giant systemd if you will.</li>
<li>Instead of running a service on a specific machine, services are submitted to the cluster via the cluster manager, fleetctl, which decides where they should run.</li>
<li>Your services/applications are in containers that act as small, ephemeral units that can easily migrate around a cluster of self-updating CoreOS machines.</li>
<li>It is smart enough to distribute services across a cluster using machine-level affinity or anti-affinity.</li>
<li>If your application consists of 5 containers fleet will guarantee that they stay running somewhere on the cluster. If a machine fails or needs to be updated, containers running on that machine will be moved to other qualified machines in the cluster.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="with-a-single-shared-brain">&hellip; with a single, shared brain</h4>

<ul>
<li>CoreOS provides a distributed key value store called &ldquo;etcd&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The etcd client runs on each machine in a cluster. etcd gracefully handles master election during network partitions and the loss of the current master.</li>
<li>Docker containers can read, write and listen to etcd over the docker0 network interface. With these three actions you construct extremely sophisticated orchestration to happen whenever etcd values change. An example of this would be listening for changes and then to reconfigure an upstream proxy when a new container of an application is started.</li>
<li>Since etcd is replicated, all changes are reflected across the entire cluster. Your application can always reach the local etcd instance at 127.0.0.1:4001.</li>
<li>Your applications can read and write data into etcd. Common examples are storing database connection details, cache settings, feature flags, and more. Let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;re running a simple web app like Wordpress. Instead of hardcoding our database address with in the config file, we&rsquo;ll fetch it from etcd instead. It&rsquo;s as simple as curl-ing <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4001/v1/keys/database">http://127.0.0.1:4001/v1/keys/database</a> and using the response within your DB connection code.</li>
</ul>

<p>##Summary</p>

<p>So now we have a hive of self-updating Linux hosts with a single, distributed init system (systemd and fleet) and a single shared brain (etcd).  It looks something like this:</p>

<p><img class="lazy img-rounded img-responsive" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" alt="CoreOS in Action" data-src="/assets/img/coreos-action.png" width="750"></p>

<p>This depicts eight containers (two load balancers and six api servers) being managed by &ldquo;fleet&rdquo; to run in various CoreOS hosts in the cluster, with shared access to etcd.</p>

<p>Momentum is shifting this way rapidly. Earlier this month Rackspace announced <a href="https://www.rackspace.com/blog/onmetal-the-right-way-to-scale/">OnMetal</a>. Rackspace&rsquo;s OnMetal Cloud Service is the first of its kind. Using OnMetal you create machine instances using OpenStack APIs but, instead of being provisioned a virtual machine, you are provisioned <strong>on physical hardware</strong>. OnMetal servers are single-tenant, bare-metal servers provisioned via the OpenStack API and can be spun up as quickly as VMs.</p>

<p>Once OnMetal is live, you&rsquo;ll be able to provision CoreOS instances on Rackspace&rsquo;s OnMetalcloud. This combination gives you the ease of spinning up machines with the click of a mouse, the security of running CoreOS with automatic updates, and the raw horsepower of running on bare metal. Pretty impressive!</p>

        Virtual Machines vs. Containers
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Mon, May 5, 2014</span>

    <p><img class="lazy img-rounded img-responsive" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" alt="Docker" data-src="/assets/img/docker.png" width="750"></p>

<p>Three driving forces of infrastructure efficiency in a large, distributed environment were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Data center consolidation <em>(KPI: How many DCs do you have?)</em></li>
<li>Host virtualization <em>(KPI: what percentage of your servers are virtual?)</em></li>
<li>&ldquo;Cloud&rdquo; in its various forms <em>(KPI: How many servers are you still running?)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming you have been aggresive you may not have any data centers left.  You may be buying services rather than servers, and/or all of your remaining machines might be virtualized and hosted in someone else&rsquo;s data center. Now what?<br />

##Where is the next level of infrastructure efficiency going to come from?</p>

<p>Personally I think the next wave of infrastructure efficiency will be driven by Linux container technology (LinuX Containers = LXC). The LXC container approach does <strong>not</strong> require a hypervisor - instead you run isolated &ldquo;containers&rdquo; on a Linux host.</p>

<p>LXC provides operating system-level virtualization, but instead of creating a full-fledged virtual machine LXC containers leverage cgroups (control groups) to completely isolate application&rsquo;s view of the operating environment, including process trees, network, user ids and mounted file systems. Cgroups are a Linux kernel feature to limit, account, and isolate resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, etc.) of process groups.</p>

<p>This work was started by engineers at Google and in late 2007 it was merged into kernel version 2.6.24. LXC also relies on other kinds of namespace-isolation functionality, which have been developed and integrated into the mainline Linux kernel since then. It looks something like this:</p>

<p><img class="lazy img-rounded img-responsive" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" alt="LXC vs. Virtual Machines" data-src="/assets/img/dockervsvm.png" width="750"></p>

<p>##Is LXC Technology Really Better?</p>

<p>Here are some of the major benefits of Linux Containers from my perspective:</p>

<p>####Fast</p>

<ul>
<li>Runtime performance at near bare metal speeds (typically 97+ percent of bare metal).</li>
<li>Management operations (boot, stop, start, reboot, etc.) in seconds or milliseconds.</li>
</ul>

<p>####Agile</p>

<ul>
<li>VM-like agility &ndash; it&rsquo;s still &ldquo;virtualization&rdquo;.</li>
<li>With VMs we often touted our ability to ship a machine &ldquo;over the wire&rdquo; since a virtual machine is basically just a large file.  It also allows better business recovery scenarios where I can have a snapshot of my production machine(s) copied to a different datacenter at regular intervals. Guess what? LXC containers are an order of magnitude smaller!</li>
<li>Developers can essentially use the exact same containers as those deployed into production.</li>
</ul>

<p>####Lightweight</p>

<ul>
<li>Just enough Operating System (JeOS); include only what you need reducing image and container bloat.</li>
<li>Minimal per container penalty which equates to greater density and hence greater returns on existing assets &ndash; imagine packing 100s or 1000s of containers on a single host node!</li>
</ul>

<p>####Inexpensive</p>

<ul>
<li>Open source &ndash; free &ndash; lower TCO.</li>
<li>Supported with out-of-the-box modern Linux kernels.</li>
<li>LXC hosting likely to drive the next wave of cloud products.</li>
</ul>

<p>####Ecosystem</p>

<ul>
<li>Growing in popularity &ndash; just checkout the google trends for docker or LXC.</li>
<li>Vibrant community and numerous 3rd party applications (1000s of prebuilt images on docker index and 100s of open source apps on github or other public sources).</li>
</ul>

<p>####Benchmarks</p>

<ul>
<li>Average boot time: LXC 1.5x faster</li>
<li>Average reboot time: LXC 18.9x faster</li>
<li>LXC CPU growth 26x lower than VM (per machine)</li>
<li>LXC Memory group 3x lower than VM (per machine)</li>
<li>LXC images 3.2x smaller than VM</li>
</ul>

<p>##Summary</p>

<p>The next wave of server density is likely to be driven by LXC technology instead of traditional VM technology.  This technology may also increase further an organizations agility, developer productivity and even business continuity. However, LXC technology is not yet as mature or &ldquo;manageable&rdquo; as VM technology, but tools like Docker are developing quickly.</p>

        Enterprise Search 2014

    <span class="post-date">Fri, Mar 14, 2014</span>

    <p><img class="lazy img-rounded img-responsive" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" alt="Google Enterprise Search" data-src="/assets/img/Google_Enterprise_Search.png" width="750"></p>

<p>One of the challenges in a large distributed enterprise is &ldquo;finding stuff&rdquo;.  Sure we call it collaboration, knowledge management, or any number of other sophisticated terms but often it boils down to just finding stuff.</p>

<p>To compensate the organization reacts by saving multiple copies and versions of a file in many different locations: email, shared file systems, intranets, etc.  Of course this compounds the issue and drives the desire to save &ldquo;my copy&rdquo; to &ldquo;somewhere where I can find it&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>A CIO&rsquo;s role is to figure out how to make this problem go away.  So we start with good solid information management concepts:</p>

<ul>
<li>We need a taxonomy of our information</li>
<li>We need to understand our &ldquo;golden copies&rdquo;, or master repositories</li>
<li>We need the information to be very easily searched and discovered by our employees - wherever they are. This problem encompasses:

<ul>
<li>Time zones</li>
<li>Languages</li>
<li>Geography and the associated latency</li>
<li>Indexing/crawling many diverse data stores</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It needs to be so simple and easy that it naturally overcomes the employee&rsquo;s desire save a personal copy.</li>
<li>We must have mature data access and permissioning processes in place.  Unleashing search on corporate systems where permissions aren&rsquo;t managed well is a huge risk.</li>
</ul>

<p>But even though these concepts are straightforward  they are not easy.  Many of us wished we could just &ldquo;Google&rdquo; our companies documents.  Google understands this and has made enterprise search a product for some time now - it was first released in 2002!  I was just taking a look at it recently and it has come a long way from where it started. Relevancy is the key however, and Google considers its relevancy calculation models to be a precious competitive differentiator and therefore keeps them opaque.</p>

<p>Many of us have tried to use Microsoft&rsquo;s platform in the past but it was always a bit of a challenge to manage, and the results were a hodgepodge.  It has also come a very long way with Microsoft&rsquo;s FAST search technology and in SharePoint 2013 there is a mature approach to deploying search.  This clarifies what had long been a confusing product line featuring many different kinds of search capability for SharePoint.</p>

<p>It is encouraging to see the progress and competition in this space. Someday soon corporate document/information search may be as simple as we are accustomed to on the web.</p>

    <p><img class="lazy img-rounded img-responsive" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" alt="IPv6 at Google" data-src="/assets/img/IPv6-google.jpg" width="750"></p>

<p>Google’s IPv6 measurements crossed the 3% milestone just under five months from when the 2% milestone was crossed.  Prior to that it had taken 11 months to go from 1% to 2%.<br />

Google is measuring the percentage of users that access Google services over IPv6.  Given the range of IPv6-connected services that Google offers, including YouTube, Google+, and Gmail, these measurements provide a good view into the amount of IPv6 deployed in access networks around the world.</p>

<p>The total percentage of <strong>IPv6 traffic is expected to cross 10% this year.</strong></p>

<h3 id="implications">Implications</h3>

<p>It is clear that IPv6 is no longer something that will be mythically deployed “some day“.  IPv6 deployment is happening. If you haven’t been thinking about making your content available over IPv6 and/or making your network work over IPv6, now is the time.</p>

<h3 id="why-ipv6">Why IPv6?</h3>

<p>If you aren&rsquo;t a networking expert here&rsquo;s the basics:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;IP&rdquo; means Internet Protocol.  It&rsquo;s how our devices speak to other.</li>
<li>Every device (<em>Every computer, mobile phone, etc.!</em>) connected to the Internet needs a numerical IP address in order to communicate with other devices. You can think of it as a unique &ldquo;phone number&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The original IP address scheme, called IPv4, is running out of numbers. It only allowed for ~4 billion addresses.</li>
<li>There are more than 7 billion people on the planet (and I personally have <em>many</em> internet devices).</li>
<li>IPv6 solves the problem of addess space.  RFC 2374 defines public addresses as being in the range 2000:: to 3FFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF. This gives us 2^125 Public IP addresses.  According to someone with better math skills than I this equals 4.2×10^37 42 undecillion IPv6 addresses currently defined and usable.<br /></li>

        A Soul Crushing Exercise

    <span class="post-date">Fri, Feb 7, 2014</span>

    <p><img class="lazy img-rounded img-responsive" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" alt="Soul Crushing" data-src="/assets/img/soulcrushing.jpg" width="750"></p>

<p>This morning I saw a post on LinkedIn by Bob Sutton who is a Stanford Professor and Co-author of Scaling up Excellence.  He discusses Adobe&rsquo;s move to abolish it&rsquo;s employee stack ranking system.  After the system was eliminated, one Adobe employee noted that a feeling of relief spread throughout the company because the old annual review system was <strong>“a soul-less and soul crushing exercise.”</strong>

Stack-ranking was popularized by Jack Welch at General Electric <em>(which has since ended the practice)</em>.  GE felt the discussions forced honesty. Stack ranking forces the discussion betweenn manager and employee to address at least one key question: &ldquo;Tell me where I rank and tell me why.&rdquo;  Some organizations go even further - terminating employees who fall into the bottom 5-10% each year.</p>

<p>My personal experience with systems like these is they force employees to play &ldquo;Game of Thrones&rdquo; at work.  It doesn&rsquo;t drive teamwork, instead employees hoard information and act on their best interests.  It also creates a culture where people are afraid to be innovative and take risks (because what if they fail?). The worst aspects may be the politics that arise, or the behaviors where people highlight failure and mistakes in others in order to make themselves look better.</p>

<p>I think W. Edwards Deming characterized stack ranking better than I ever could:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“It nourishes short-term performance, annihilates long-term planning, builds fear, demolishes teamwork, nourishes rivalry and politics. It leaves people bitter, crushed, bruised, battered, desolate, despondent, dejected, feeling inferior some even depressed, unfit for work for weeks after receipt of rating, unable to comprehend why they are inferior. It is unfair, as it ascribes to the people in a group differences that may be caused totally by the system that they work in.”</p>

<p><em>- W. Edwards Deming - Out of the Crisis (1986)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="adobe-s-changes">Adobe&rsquo;s Changes:</h3>

<ul>
<li>No more annual reviews, but managers are expected to have frequent “check-ins” with employees to provide targeted coaching and advice. There is no prescribed format or frequency for these conversations, and managers don’t complete any forms or use any technologies to guide or document what happens during such conversations.</li>
<li>One of the main goals was to <strong>subtract technology</strong>* from the feedback process.  Adobe didn’t want managers to hide behind forms and computers. Instead, managers should focus on having candid and open conversations with the people they lead.</li>
<li>Once a year, managers make adjustments in employee compensation. Managers have far more discretion over such decisions than in the past: they have nearly complete authority to allocate their budget among their charges as they see fit.</li>
<li>Employees are compensated based on how well they have met their goals - not on the &ldquo;bell curve&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="adobe-s-results">Adobe&rsquo;s Results:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Voluntary attrition at Adobe has dropped 30% - much of which used to happen right after annual reviews.</li>
<li>Involuntary departures have <em>increased</em> by 50%. because the new system requires executives and managers to have regular “tough discussions” with employees who are struggling with performance issues — rather than putting them off until the next review cycle.</li>
<li>78% of employees report that their manager is open to feedback from them, a sizeable improvement over past surveys.</li>
<li>Eliminated the cost of employee review tracking and management system.</li>
<li>Saved an estimated 80,000 hours of time from the 2000 managers at Adobe each year, the equivalent of 40 full-time employees. <em>(although I feel this is suspect assuming managers spend at least as much, and hopefully more, time giving employees informal feedback instead)</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="takeways">Takeways</h3>

<p>Companies who claim they want all &ldquo;A&rdquo; players and then force a bell curve on them are doing themselves a disservice.  This is not an internally consistent approach, and demotivates groups of employees who really are all top performers. If you really want all top performers you need an approach that allows everyone to excel.</p>

<p>In addition you need a culture that top performers find enticing:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A sense of purpose</strong> - what is the mission of the company?<br /></li>
<li><strong>Clear goals</strong> - What am I expected to contribute? What are the &ldquo;the rules&rdquo;?</li>
<li><strong>Linkage of company success to personal success</strong> - &ldquo;A&rdquo; players are competive and want to be on a winning team. They also want to be recognized for their contribution.</li>
<li><strong>Positive feedback</strong> - &ldquo;A&rdquo; players are used to positive feedback loops.  They don&rsquo;t respond well to negative feedback loops.  Make sure you tell them how important they are and exactly where and how they are doing well, <em>then</em> you can share how they can improve.<br /></li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Listened to&rdquo; and respected</strong> - By definition &ldquo;A&rdquo; players are smart - listen to them!  If an &ldquo;A&rdquo; player shares a great idea to improve the company and it is seriously considered and/or implemented they will feel great (and probably will come up with many more ideas).</li>
</ul>

<p>Surprise - a culture like this works for everyone!</p>

        Fixing Windows 8

    <span class="post-date">Sat, Feb 1, 2014</span>

    <p><img class="lazy img-rounded img-responsive" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" alt="Windows Start Menu" data-src="/assets/img/windows8.jpg" width="750"></p>

<p>I just saw <a href="http://jaymachalani.com/blog/2013/12/12/fixing-windows-8">this piece</a> by Jay Machalani about restructuring the UI/UX of Windows 8.  It&rsquo;s a brilliant piece of work!</p>

<p>He did significant research to inform his opinions and came up with 5 key design rules to guide his work which are really at the heart of the issues and confusion that users are currently facing.

In addition I think Jay has a great handle on <strong>the key issue</strong>.  Many people have framed it as the loss of the start menu but the real issue is that Microsoft made Metro the <em>primary</em> interface and the traditional desktop was pushed down as a second class citizen and made more difficult to access.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Metro is treated like it’s the core of Windows; that everything is attached to and passes through it. The Desktop in Windows 7 gave you a single level where you could access all your files, apps and settings, but since Metro can’t really replace your Desktop yet, because Microsoft didn’t work out a way to use the Classic apps in it, you’re now stuck with two levels to access everything in your computer. The whole Desktop including your Classic apps is now considered an app inside of Metro; that is messed up!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His suggestion is to make the tradional desktp and metro peers.  This led him to reimagine the start menu in a really clever way.  Definitely worth a read - I hope the Microsoft UI/UX team is looking <strong>very</strong> closely at this.</p>

        Facebook Saves a Billion Dollars via Open Compute Designs
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Tue, Jan 28, 2014</span>

    <p><img class="lazy img-rounded img-responsive" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" alt="Facebook Server" data-src="/assets/img/fb-server.jpg" width="750"></p>

<p>Last week, IBM announced that it was selling its low-end server business to Chinese hardware manufacturer Lenovo. The deal has been widely viewed as the logical result of the commoditization of x86-based servers, in much the same way PCs were commoditized a decade ago.</p>

<p>This week Microsoft announced it is joining the Open Compute Project and will “open source” its server designs, sharing them with the world at large.  Microsoft joins Facebook, Google, Amazon, Bloomberg, Intel, Box and many others.  Microsoft will be contributing designs for the servers that power global cloud services like Windows Azure, Office 365, and Bing.

It&rsquo;s clear that the server business is never going to be same.  For Microsoft open source goes against it&rsquo;s DNA, and for IBM the server business was viewed as core not so long ago.</p>

<h3 id="billion-dollar-idea">Billion Dollar Idea</h3>

<p>Facebook started this movement in 2011, when it open sourced its first server designs and founded the Open Compute Project.  The aim was to foster a community who would share hardware designs and bootstrap a more efficient means of getting these designs built.</p>

<p>Now, nearly three years later, the project lets Facebook crowdsource improvements to its infrastructure and <strong>allows multiple vendors to produce identical equipment</strong> which gives Facebook supply chain diversity. In addition there is no vendor &ldquo;support&rdquo; costs, and you self-insure against failure via redundancy.  So your true investment is only the hardware and engineering talent necessary to operate it.  This is a CIO&rsquo;s dream.</p>

<p>Today at the Open Compute Summit, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that &ldquo;In the last three years alone, Facebook has saved more than <strong>a billion dollars</strong> in building out our infrastructure using Open Compute designs.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Million Dollars Isn&rsquo;t Cool. You Know What&rsquo;s Cool? A Billion Dollars.</p>

<p><em>- Sean Parker in &ldquo;The Social Network&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Zuckerberg also noted that &ldquo;In just the last year we’ve saved the equivalent amount of energy of 40,000 homes in a year, and saved the amount of emissions equivalent to taking 50,000 cars off the road for a year.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="next-up-network-gear">Next Up - Network Gear</h3>

<p>In the recent past switches were black boxes with integrated data planes, control planes and feature sets from <strong>a single vendor</strong>. The cost for sufficient capacity and performance was prohibitive. The challenge of making changes made the network brittle and network engineers gun-shy.</p>

<p>Today however merchant silicon has surpassed custom Applications Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). This in turn enables enterprise grade networking hardware from Original Device Manufacturers (ODMs) - bare metal network hardware.</p>

<p>What becomes critical is the software layer to manage and operate the network. Google was an early driver of software defined networking on top of bare metal commodity hardware.  They helped define OpenFlow and breathe life into this technology.</p>

<p>This area is rapidly maturing and today we see examples like Dell hoping to sell hardware and services through a partnership with Silicon Valley startup <a href="http://cumulusnetworks.com/">Cumulus Networks</a>.</p>

<p>So what is going to happen to Cisco?  Wonder why they were <a href="http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/01/cisco-systems-inc-csco-downgraded-by-jpmorgan/">downgraded</a> today by J.P. Morgan?</p>

<h3 id="trickle-down-effect">Trickle Down Effect</h3>

<p>All of this innovation is benefiting corporate clients who will either have better, faster, less expensive cloud platforms to leverage, or by directly reducing cost and complexity in their own data centers.  Saving energy and being &ldquo;greener&rdquo; is icing on the cake.</p>

        Billion Dollar March Madness Bracket

    <span class="post-date">Wed, Jan 22, 2014</span>

    <p><img class="lazy img-rounded img-responsive" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" alt="FX Trading UI" data-src="/assets/img/ncaa-brackets.jpg" width="750"></p>

<p>Quicken Loans and Warren Buffet annouced a billion dollar prize for a perfect NCAA college bracket prediction. As Quicken Loans puts it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You read that right: one billion. Not one million. Not one hundred million. Not five hundred million. One billion U.S. dollars.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="why-give-away-a-billion-dollars">Why Give Away a Billion Dollars?</h2>

<p>My first reaction when I heard this is &ldquo;where is the value?&rdquo;.  Companies award prizes all time and we know the reason this occurs is basic economics - which teaches us that the &ldquo;cost&rdquo; of the prize is less than the &ldquo;value&rdquo; the company derives from offering the prize.  So what amount marketing, exposure or publicity is worth <strong>one billion dollars?</strong>

The details of the prize are actually $25 million dollars for 40 years. So we can reframe the question as &ldquo;What amount of addional loan volume must Quicken Loans generate to produce more than $25 million of additional profit annually?&rdquo;  To get there we need to know the average revenue per loan and Quicken&rsquo;s profit margin.  For example if we assume $1,500 revenue per loan and a $10% profit margin this means Quicken Loans would earn a profit of $150 per loan.  So $25,000,000 / $150 = 166,667 loans (rounding up).</p>

<h2 id="this-all-may-be-moot">This All May be Moot</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s virtually impossible to predict a perfect bracket.  The math is simple: there are sixty-three games so it&rsquo;s 2 to the sixty-third power.  The odds of you filling out a perfect bracket are a staggering 1 in 9.2 quintillion.</p>

<h4 id="how-big-is-that">How big is that?</h4>

<ul>
<li>That&rsquo;s one billion, 9.2 billion times.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s 500,000 times more than our $17 trillion national debt.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="but-i-m-a-brackets-wizard">But I&rsquo;m a Brackets Wizard!</h4>

<p>If you are really smart and know that No. 1 seeds always advance in the first round, or tournament champions usually have a top-four seed, or about Duke&rsquo;s dual advantage of having a legend like Coach K and never getting called for a blocking foul you may be able to cut the odds down to something more like 1 in 128 billion.</p>

<p>Get schooled by DePaul math professor Jay Bergen:</p>

<p><iframe width="750" height="422" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/O6Smkv11Mj4" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Using 1 in 128 billion odds, if everyone in the United States filled out a bracket, we&rsquo;d see a perfect one <strong>every 400 years</strong>!  ESPN which has run a tournament challenge for the past 16 years has <strong>never had a perfect bracket in over 30 million entries</strong> according to the network.  I assume that many of the people filling those out are pretty smart.</p>

<h2 id="true-genius">True Genius!</h2>

<p>So the true genius of this is the prize will almost certainly not be awarded thus the marketing, exposure and publicity is free!  I initially puzzled over why Warren Buffet was involved but as a long time insurance executive he must have some sense of the actuarial odds on this. Brilliant!</p>

    <span class="post-date">Mon, Jan 13, 2014</span>

    <p><img class="lazy img-rounded img-responsive" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" alt="FX Trading UI" data-src="/assets/img/new-ui.jpg" width="750"></p>

<p>I was reading up on the &ldquo;MEAN&rdquo; stack: Mongo, Express, Angular and Node and came across a blog post from <a href="http://francescak.me/blog/2013/04/09/fintech-hackathon-recap/">Francesca Krihely</a> about the FinTech hackathon in NY from back in April, 2013.</p>

<p>This interested me because as a former &ldquo;insider&rdquo; in a large financial services company I can see clearly how open source code and tooling is replacing more proprietry code and tooling (for example .net/visual studio) but it requires an entirely different skill set for internal developers.

For the corporate economics to work the cost of the &ldquo;new&rdquo; platform has to be not just lower (or more productive) than the old, but low enough to also fund the transition (i.e. reskilling or hiring of the types of developers that would be needed) as well as overcome corporate inertia. The hard part is predicting &ldquo;when&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I get the sense that the momentum is picking up. The NY hackathon atracted over 400 people and the apps/apis were very interesting (you can read Francesca&rsquo;s post for more) but all built on a modern technology stack.</p>

<p>The underlying technology stacks of companies like Twitter, Facebook, eBay, etc. are designed for millions of events per minute.  There is an obvious parallel to trading technology where you need to deliver real-time news, tick data, messages, etc. to a user interface that allows for quick understanding and reaction.</p>

<p>One of the companies I discovered is <a href="https://openf.in/">OpenFin</a>.  Since I used to deliver equity trading applications to global trading desks I know the challenges well.  I really like the approach here and it&rsquo;s clear to me this is what the future holds.  This is similar to <a href="http://www.caplin.com">Caplin.com</a> and others.</p>

<p>It is really exciting to see all the innovation!</p>

<p>Using Caplin&rsquo;s technology for example I can show a simple <em>example</em> feed for Apple Stock with a little javascript:</p>

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://platform.caplin.com/sljs/streamlink.js"></script>

    // Get the streamLink.
    var streamLink = caplin.streamlink.StreamLinkFactory.create({

                  password: "cappass",
      liberator_urls: "rttp://platform.caplin.com"
    });

    // Define the subscription listener.
    var subscriptionListener = {

      onSubscriptionStatus : function(subscription, event) {
        log(subscription.getSubject() + " is now " + event.getStatus());
      },

      onSubscriptionError : function(subscription, event) {
        log("Error: Subject " + subscription.getSubject() + " is " + event.getError());
      },

      onRecordUpdate : function(subscription, event) {
        //Place each updated field into a map of all events.
        //This will act as a cache of all the current values,
        //not just the values updated in this event
        for (field in event.getFields())
        {
          fields[field] = event.getFields()[field];
        }
        render();
        streamlink.disconnect();
      }
    };

    // Display the latest record values.
    var fields = {};
    function render() {
       document.getElementById("recordLog").innerHTML = symbol + "\t" +
        fields["BestBid"] + "\t" + fields["BestAsk"] + "\t" + fields["VolumeAcc"] + "\t" + fields["NetChange"] + "\t" + fields["Time"] + "\t" + fields["Last"];
    }

    // Subscribe to the record.
    var symbol = "AAPL";
    var subject = "/EXAMPLES/PRICING/TYPE1/" + symbol;

        Responsive Design vs. Mobile-First
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Tue, Dec 31, 2013</span>

    <p>I have heard some people speak of &ldquo;mobile-first&rdquo; and &ldquo;responsive design&rdquo; interchangeably making them sound as if they were one and the same.  However I think there are some subtle differences.  I believe responsive design is the broadest possible definition. It says to me that we are going to target all platforms, screen sizes, pixel densities, etc.  It means that the user experience will be custom tailored to the exact device you just happen to be viewing it with. This should be our ulimate goal, right?

&ldquo;Mobile-first&rdquo; is a narrower definition and implies that the majority of the design effort is going to be geared towards the mobile experience.  But there are a lot of other things it doesn&rsquo;t clarify such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Definition of &ldquo;Mobile&rdquo; - aren&rsquo;t smartphones, tablets and laptops <strong>all</strong> mobile? Do we really mean &ldquo;Smartphone-first&rdquo;?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Mobile Only&rdquo; vs &ldquo;Mobile First&rdquo; - what will the support level be on &ldquo;non-mobile&rdquo; devices?</li>
</ul>

<p>The second point is interesting because the the first wave of responsive design was focused on taking websites designed for a large screen and simplifying and stripping them down so they would &ldquo;fit&rdquo; and work well on a phone.</p>

<p>If we now start with a &ldquo;mobile-first&rdquo; design how should we <em>add to it</em> to create the desktop experience?  It seems easier to start with something a little more complex and then simplify it rather than start with something simple and try to add complexity to it.  Said another way if you distilled your site to work great on a smartphone then what are you going to add back? That&rsquo;s one of the tough aspects of responsive design.</p>

<p>When people first started using the term mobile-first I think some meant that instead of starting with a desktop design and then progressively degrading it to work on smaller and smaller screens we should start with a highly optimized mobile site and then progressively enhance it for larger screens.  This model makes sense as long as we are actually thinking about, and designing for, all screen sizes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Side note: One of the best aspects of mobile design is the
performance tuning required to make a site run well on a smartphone
because it pays speed dividends on <strong>every device, everywhere</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe in the mobile-first progressive enhancement approach but I&rsquo;d still rather say we doing responsive design over mobile-first because to me it says we are going make our site work great everywhere, for everyone.</p>

        Why is Apple&#39;s Capital Expenditure up 57% for 2014?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Wed, Oct 30, 2013</span>

    <p><img class="lazy img-rounded img-responsive" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" alt="Apple's Campus" data-src="/assets/img/iSpaceship.jpg" width="750"></p>

<p>Apple’s most recent 10-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission shows the company has budgeted <strong>$11 billion in capital expenditures for fiscal 2014</strong>.</p>

<p>This is more than <strong>5 times</strong> Apple&rsquo;s capital expenditure in 2010 and <strong>57 percent more than the $7 billion it spent in 2013</strong>.</p>

<p>What is Apple planning to do with all that additional money?

According to <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2013/10/30/how-many-ios-devices-will-be-produced-in-the-next-12-months/">Horace Dediu</a> perhaps Apple is just conducting business as usual and the increased CAPEX simply reflects potentially higher sales volumes for iOS devices in 2014.  He has a chart that tracks capital expenditure against iOS device volume and they track very closely.  But I think the relationship may be somewhat coincidental.</p>

<p>Consider Apple&rsquo;s desire to move away from Samsung. Be it on displays or in chips, I suspect this strategic direction is increasing CAPEX significantly without any corresponding unit sale increases.</p>

<p>I also suspect the new campus has a significant impact. In addition we must consider the data centers Apple has been building over the last 2 years to support it&rsquo;s cloud services - clearly not production related CAPEX.</p>

<p>Logically a portion of 2014 CAPEX is going to new device development and production - the iPhone 6 will very likely have a new form-factor and design.  The iPod line needs a refesh.  But the iPad Mini and iPad Air in my opinion will remain as is in 2014.  So is the iPhone and iPod enough to drive CAPEX up that strongly?  I doubt it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-30/apple-s-capital-spending-to-rise-to-11-billion-for-fiscal-2014.html">Earlier this week, Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said the company is working on new releases in technology categories where it doesn’t yet compete.</a>  So perhaps an iWatch or an iTV is what is driving this spend.  But maybe there is something really revolutionary coming.  Personally I want to be surprised and amazed in 2014 - just like when the original iPhone was introduced back in 20007.</p>

        Intrinsic Bias
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Tue, Oct 15, 2013</span>

    <p><img class="lazy img-rounded img-responsive" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" alt="Bias" data-src="/assets/img/bias.jpg" width="750"></p>

<p>As a CIO in a large, publicly owned financial services company I held the responsibility of keeping our client&rsquo;s (and our organization’s) data safe and secure.  As the economics of cloud services became compelling the largest hurdle to adoption was &ldquo;potential security risks&rdquo;, by a large measure.</p>

<p>Let me explain what I mean by &ldquo;potential security risks&rdquo;.   Recently Ben Fried, Google&rsquo;s CIO, made a <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20131010/google-cio-ben-fried-on-how-google-works/">remark about Dropbox</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The important thing to understand about Dropbox,” Fried said, “is
that when your users use it in a corporate context, <strong>your corporate
data is being held in someone else’s data center.</strong>”</p>

<p><em>(Emphasis added)</em>
</p>

<h3 id="how-ironic">How Ironic</h3>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s a problem just because your data is in someone else&rsquo;s data center?  That doesn&rsquo;t sound good for Google&rsquo;s business model. Fried and Google now say that he misspoke. Fried says he meant that the real concern about Dropbox is <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20131015/google-cio-ben-fried-clarifies-remarks-on-dropbox/">more around security</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Any third-party cloud providers that our employees use must pass
our thorough security review and agree under contract to maintain
certain security levels,”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="reading-between-the-lines">Reading Between the Lines</h3>

<p>The second statement is the &ldquo;politically correct&rdquo; one.  However, the first statement is much closer to the truth in many organizations.  What Fried was saying is that Google doesn&rsquo;t trust Dropbox as much as they trust themselves.  Most organizations share this same intrinsic bias.</p>

<p>The reality is that security standards are slightly fuzzy.  Internal IT organizations potentially see third party services (or &ldquo;the cloud&rdquo;) as a threat to their livelihood so they highlight possible security risks of external providers while sweeping their own under the rug.  Internal auditors, compliance staff, and risk staff like to look at things, interview people and document stuff.  When a service is external they feel a bit left out.  As a result many companies have higher standards for third parties than what they hold themselves accountable.</p>

<p>Clearly <strong>both</strong> Google and Dropbox are businesses that depend on trust.  Consumers and businesses are willing to use, and pay for, IT services from these organizations as long as their information is protected and secure.  Without this level of trust <strong>neither</strong> business would be viable (although one could argue that Google could still rely on it&rsquo;s advertising business).</p>

<h3 id="broader-implications">Broader Implications</h3>

<p>Trust is also a key ingredient in making a financial services business viable.  Why would I ever buy insurance, banking services or invest my savings via a company that I didn&rsquo;t trust?  When the financial markets were impacted by the sub-prime debt crisis in 2008 the public view of financial services took a nosedive.  Companies that were created to help you buy a home, save for college, your retirement, or protect you from loss were suddenly the bad guys.  The result was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street">Occupy Wall Street</a>.</p>

<p>It became clear that to succeed in the future the financial services industry would need to rebuild it&rsquo;s image.  Companies would need to zealously rebuild their brands as &ldquo;trusted advisors&rdquo;.  From an IT standpoint it is crystal clear that client and corporate data must be guarded and protected to prevent any loss as well as minimize the potential for damage to an organization&rsquo;s reputation.  Additionally it is clear that movements like Occupy Wall Street and Wikileaks were targeting large financial services companies.</p>

<p>The response to this need for trustworthy computing by many companies runs along the same view expressed by Google&rsquo;s Ben Fried, namely we can&rsquo;t have our data &ldquo;out there&rdquo; in someone else&rsquo;s datacenter, under someone else&rsquo;s control because it&rsquo;s too risky.</p>

<p>There are some legitimate reasons for this view:</p>

<ul>
<li>Concerns regarding legal discovery</li>
<li>Concerns regarding the ability to respond to regulators</li>
<li>Lack of clarity from the regulators</li>
<li>Lack of clarity regarding liability for lost of stolen data (or no liability!)</li>
</ul>

<p>However at the end of the day these are issues that can be addressed if we really want to capture the economic benefits.</p>

<h3 id="capturing-the-benefits-the-contrarian-view">Capturing the Benefits - The Contrarian View</h3>

<p>This is where it gets interesting.  I have made the argument that I think using tools like Google Drive or Dropbox <strong>responsibly</strong> is actually likely to be <strong>more secure</strong> than managing our data ourselves.</p>

<h4 id="why">Why?</h4>

<ul>
<li>Data security and trust are at the heart of the business for companies like Google and Dropbox - therefore it is funded properly.</li>
<li>More transparency.  Many, many businesses are looking for holes or reasons not to use the service - in order to overcome this resistance the data security has to be really good, and well documented, and well audited.</li>
<li>It is tested daily by thousands of hackers.</li>
<li>It is &ldquo;usable&rdquo; security - meaning it is baked into the usability of the products rather than &ldquo;bolted on&rdquo; corporate IT security.  This is important because users won&rsquo;t actively try to circumvent it. In the corporate world if you put too many restrictions in place people start emailing documents to their Gmail account so they can work on them at home. Not good.</li>
<li>Your reputational risk is <strong>lower</strong>.  I will explain further below.</li>
</ul>

<p>No amount of security in the real world is perfect.  Therefore Dropbox, Google and your organization <strong>will get hacked</strong>.  It&rsquo;s inevitable, and no matter where your data resides you will need to tell your clients and/or your employees if any personally identifying information was potentially accessed.  You may also need to notify your regulators and others - so no real difference here.</p>

<p>But what will the headlines say? &ldquo;Dropbox Security Breach&rdquo; or &ldquo;{Your Company Here} Security Breach&rdquo;?  I&rsquo;d rather not see the headline with my company&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p>I believe the public is more understanding because they use these services too.  If you had corporate data at Dropbox or Google and they were breached and you had to send notification to your clients you could explain that while you did your due diligence a security breach still occurred at one of your service providers.  Further, you will scrutinize their response and switch providers and/or bring the data back internally if necessary.</p>

<p>I would also argue the economics of scale-based cloud services are even more compelling than people realize for large companies:</p>

<ul>
<li>Less internal IT cost (the most obvious savings)</li>
<li>Less IT oversight cost (internal audit, risk, compliance, external audit, etc.)  These are significant costs in large, regulated organizations.</li>
<li>Less &ldquo;prevention&rdquo; cost - i.e. tools to prevent installation of Dropbox, audit or removal of the software, etc.</li>
<li>Higher productivity and a better overall user experience with leads to less user training and higher adoption.  Imagine a user with an iPad grabbing a document for a meeting from Dropbox or Google drive vs. an internally cooked up solution that requires a VPN connection, less polished software, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="summing-up">Summing Up</h3>

<p>So it&rsquo;s <strong>even less expensive than you think and potentially even more secure</strong>.  Therefore I am in strong agreement with Ben Fried&rsquo;s second, clarified statement.</p>

<p>If you watch someone run the 100 meters, they sneak glances around. Sprinters watch each other while they run.  They want to know where are in the pack and what place they might get.  I noticed that only Usain Bolt looks at the clock.
</p>

<p>Usain Bolt looks at the clock because maybe he’s used to being ahead of everyone else.  But I think it is <em>because he is really only competing against himself</em>.</p>

<p>When trying to introduce innovation I often get asked a frustrating question. The question is &ldquo;Who else is using this?&rdquo; or &ldquo;How does Blackrock / PIMCO / Janus / Etc. do it?&rdquo;.  It is even worse when talking about policy because I am almost guaranteed to hear: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Goldman&rsquo;s / Barclay&rsquo;s / Fidelity&rsquo;s policy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seems in order to make a decision some people want to know what everyone else is doing first.  This line of questioning is almost inevitable in a large organization but it makes me cringe when I hear it.</p>

<p>Think about it for a moment. This isn&rsquo;t the recipe for leadership and innovation.  This is the recipe for risk avoidance/going with the heard.  It is the sprinters in the pack looking around to see where everyone else is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>PROTIP:</strong>
You can&rsquo;t define your metrics in terms of others. In other words
&ldquo;We want to be in the top quartile&rdquo; means you are just in the pack
watching everyone else. Define your goals simply, directly, and on
your own terms: &ldquo;Our margin will be 40%&rdquo; or &ldquo;We will bring in
$1 Billion in net flows&rdquo; and then watch <strong>your</strong> scoreboard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you really want to lead then you should only look at your target, the clock, your scoreboard because <strong>everyone else is behind you.</strong></p>

        Hosting your Blog on Amazon S3
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Thu, Jul 25, 2013</span>

    <p>One of the cleanest designed blogs I have seen in a while belongs to <a href="http://blog.yourkarma.com/">Karma Mobility</a>.  So I asked in the comments on a particularly interesting post by Stefan Borsje and he very nicely responded &ldquo;Thanks Daniel! This blog uses Jekyll and is hosted on S3.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hmmm.  That&rsquo;s two cool things at once.
</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s do this! I know a little about Jekyll and I know it&rsquo;s engine behind GitHub Pages, plus om Github you can host it for free.But it has two disadvantages I know of:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can not use custom Jekyll plugins with GitHub Pages. Your site is generated with <code>--safe</code>.</li>
<li>There is no possibility to redirect requests. This is vital if you do not want to lose any link traffic when fixing a typo in your URL.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="jekyll-on-amazon-s3">Jekyll on Amazon S3</h3>

<p>In order to serve your site from S3 you need to first create a bucket to hold the content. So, using the S3 web console create a bucket.</p>

<p>Next we need to setup the bucket for web hosting. Click the properties button to edit the properties of your new bucket.  Then go to the Static Website Hosting section and click &ldquo;Enabled website hosting&rdquo;. Note the Endpoint of your site and remember to save!</p>

<p>You also need to set your index document.  I chose index.html for my index document and nothing for my error document since I am using a redirect rule to redirect all errors back to the root of my blog.  That way no one ever gets a 404.  Cool right?</p>

<p>The rule is simple:
{% highlight xml %}
<RoutingRules>
  <RoutingRule>
  <Condition>
    <HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals>403</HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals >
  </Condition>
  <Redirect>
    <HostName>error.html</HostName>
  </Redirect>
  </RoutingRule>
</RoutingRules>
{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;Permissions&rdquo; section you also need to add a bucket policy that makes your bucket content publicly available:
{% highlight json %}
  {
    &ldquo;Version&rdquo;: &ldquo;2008-10-17&rdquo;,
    &ldquo;Statement&rdquo;: [
        {
            &ldquo;Sid&rdquo;: &ldquo;PublicReadForGetBucketObjects&rdquo;,
            &ldquo;Effect&rdquo;: &ldquo;Allow&rdquo;,
            &ldquo;Principal&rdquo;: {
                &ldquo;AWS&rdquo;: &ldquo;<em>&ldquo;
            },
            &ldquo;Action&rdquo;: &ldquo;s3:GetObject&rdquo;,
            &ldquo;Resource&rdquo;: &ldquo;arn:aws:s3:::snapvotr-blog/</em>&ldquo;
        }
    ]
  }
{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>Now you could click Upload next and push your site up on S3.</p>

<h3 id="but-we-have-another-trick-up-our-sleeve-s3-website">But we have another trick up our sleeve - s3_website</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website">s3_website</a></p>

<p>First if you are already running Jekyll then you should have all the dependencies already setup.  So just run:
{% highlight text %}
gem install s3_website
{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>To configure s3_website, make sure you are in your website’s root directory, then run:
{% highlight text %}
s3_website cfg create
{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>This generates a configuration file called <code>s3_website.yml</code>. Open it in a text editor and change the values to your AWS secret and key ID.  This is where you also name your Amazon S3 bucket.  I used &ldquo;blog.mywebsite.com&rdquo; since I was setting up my site&rsquo;s blog.</p>

<p>{% highlight yaml %}
s3_id: [YOUR AWS S3 ACCESS KEY ID]
s3_secret: [YOUR AWS S3 SECRET ACCESS KEY]
s3_bucket: [BUCKET NAME]
{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>Next, save the file and run this command in your Terminal.
{% highlight text %}
s3_website cfg apply
{% endhighlight %}
The S3 bucket will be automatically created for you by this command. The command will also ask if you want to use Amazon&rsquo;s CloudFront CDN.  I said &ldquo;y&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In hindsight I would have kept it simple and made sure everything was working properly from S3 first.  If you do enable it there are some additional steps you have to do on Amazon:
* You have to tell CloudFront what CNAME(s) you will be using.  So Login, edit your new CloudFront distribution and fill in the &ldquo;Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)&rdquo; field. Since I was creating a blog I used &ldquo;blog.website.com&rdquo; with my own domain of course. <img class="img-rounded img-responsive" alt="image of Amazon management console" src="/assets/img/CloudFront_Management_Console.png">
* You also need to tweak the origin per the link in the references - you need a <strong>custom origin</strong>* pointing to your S3 bucket.</p>

<p>Now, deploying your website is as simple as running:
{% highlight text %}
s3_website push
{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>When I am done adding content or tweaking I can build and deploy with two commands:
{% highlight text %}
jekyll build
s3_website push
{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>That my friends is AWESOME!</p>

<h3 id="setup-your-cname-with-your-dns-provider">Setup your CNAME with your DNS provider</h3>

<p>You must be able to point a CNAME at CloudFront.  I was creating a blog so it was easy.  You do this via your DNS provider, which in many cases is your domain registrar unless you already moved your DNS hosting elsewhere.  I created a blog CNAME (so my URL will end up being blog.website.com) pointing to the Amazon CloudFront domain that was assigned.  It looks like this: xxxxxxxxxxxx.cloudfront.net.  Boom! done.</p>

        Risk Mitigation Costs Too Much
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Fri, Nov 16, 2012</span>

    <p><img class="lazy img-rounded img-responsive" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" alt="Thomas Edison" data-src="/assets/img/edison.jpg" width="750"></p>

<p>Many large organizations work exceptionally hard minimize &ldquo;risk&rdquo;.   Ironically, by working so diligently to reduce risk they may be paying for it anyway, and reducing innovation at the same time.

From Joel Spolsky’s <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html">Camels and Rubber Duckies</a>: <em>(with some minor editing)</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Software is priced three ways: free, cheap, and dear.</p>

<p><strong>Free:</strong> Open source, etc. Many big companies are still
apprehensive about open source.  They want someone responsible
with deep pockets who will take their call when something goes
south. Open source feels risky because there is no one else to
blame.</p>

<p><strong>Cheap:</strong> $10 – $1,000, sold to a very large number of
people at a low price without a salesforce. Most shrinkwrapped
consumer and small business software falls into this category.</p>

<p><strong>Dear:</strong> $75,000 – $1,000,000+, sold to a few big companies
using a team of slick salespeople that do six months of PowerPoint
meetings just to get one sale. The Oracle model.</p>

<p>All three methods work fine.  Notice the gap?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>There’s no software priced between $1,000 and $75,000.</strong> The minute you charge more than $1,000 you need to get <em>signoffs</em>. You need a line item in the budget. You need purchasing manager involvement and competitive bids and paperwork and approvals. So you need to send a salesperson out to the customer to do PowerPoint, with his airfare and $19.95 movies at the Marriott. The cost of making one successful sale is going to average about $50,000. If you’re sending salespeople out to customers and charging less than $75,000, you’re losing money.</p>

<p>Big companies want to avoid &ldquo;risk&rdquo; when choosing commercial software.  They study, research, call up references.  In order to sell to them you need competent sales people who can spend weeks just to get a one hour meeting; People who understand how to build consensus and can “tick all the boxes” for security, compliance, internal audit, business continuity, etc.</p>

<p>Ironically, large companies protect themselves so well that they  drive up the cost of enterprise software, which mostly goes towards the cost of jumping all the hurdles that they have set up to minimize risk.</p>

<p>Is it worth it?  It depends on circumstances but I think the engine of innovation is the ability to try and fail, and learn.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.”</p>

<p><em>- Thomas Edison</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems counter intuitive but in many companies one way to <strong>lower cost</strong> and increase innovation is to embrace a little risk.  Lower the hurdles. Lower the “shame” of failure and innovation can thrive.  Companies that won’t take risk and punish failure tend to be the least innovative – and worse their costs aren’t lower either.</p>

<p>The United Arab Emirates holds the largest biometric database in
the world, the Emirates Identity Authority has announced. The
population register of Emirates ID has over <strong>103 million digital
fingerprints and over 15 million digital facial recognition
records</strong>, which includes multiple records of each UAE resident,
and digital signatures as of October 11, senior officials said.</p>

<p>Dr. Ali Al Khoury, Director General of Emirates ID, said the
authority has submitted an official application to the World
Record Academy to recognize this record. Asked about the
confirmation of the authority’s claims about the world record, an
official spokesman of the authority told Gulf News on Sunday: &ldquo;We
have made worldwide surveys and inquiries with the similar
official authorities and agencies of the world governments holding
such databases and confirmed that our database is the largest. The
World Record Academy also confirmed to us that no other government
or authority has made a similar claim for such a record.&rdquo; 1
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question you should be asking yourself right now is “for what purpose?” Collecting and storing all that data costs millions. What is the value of having it? Who has access to it? Why make it so publicly known?</p>

<p>The Emirates Identity Authority states the benefits are:</p>

<ul>
<li>ID Card is mandatory for all citizen [sic] and legal residence [sic] 15 years [sic] and above</li>
<li>Identification and Verification as per International Standards</li>
<li>Protect individuals’ identity</li>
<li>Can be used to access Secure eServices</li>
<li>Provides Identity Information</li>
<li>Stores many ID applications in future</li>
<li>Prevents fraud &amp; Identity Theft</li>
<li>Portable personal database</li>
</ul>

<p>Note the first <em>benefit</em> listed is that it is mandatory for all people 15 years of age and older.</p>

<h3 id="let-s-come-up-with-some-ideas-of-our-own">Let’s come up with some ideas of our own:</h3>

<p><strong>Government Services:</strong> This is the most obvious use. Governments collect taxes and provide services to their citizens. They need a simple, cheap, accurate way to identify you to prevent fraud. In the US we are familiar with the concept of people defrauding Social Security, Medicare, and many other government programs. Would a method that cuts down or eliminates fraud pay for itself?</p>

<p>Take it a step further – Imagine if you went to access a government service and it recognizes you and verifies you are qualified to receive the service, yet it also determines you have not filed an income tax return in four years. What would we expect to happen?</p>

<p><strong>Crime:</strong> The information could be used to as a better way to fight crime. Imagine a country that has facial recognition records and fingerprints of all citizens. Let’s assume you commit a crime and are caught by conventional methods but lie about your identity – will you get away with it?</p>

<p>Now imagine the country develops and deploys a video surveillance network in its major cities. I would imagine these tools could be used in a positive way to deter crime. It would lower the chance of false accusation of innocent people. People who have exhibited a pattern of crime could even be automatically and continuously monitored and tracked.</p>

<p>Many people have seen the movie “Minority Report”. What if I told the United States is trying it out, for real? Our Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is betting on algorithms: it’s building a “prototype screening facility” that it hopes will use factors such as ethnicity, gender, breathing, and heart rate to “detect cues indicative of mal-intent.” DHS calls its “pre-crime” system Future Attribute Screening Technology, or FAST.</p>

<p>DHS has conducted preliminary research in operational settings to determine the feasibility of using non-invasive physiological and behavioral sensor technology and observational techniques to detect signs of stress, which are often associated with intent to do harm. 2</p>

<p><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Imagine your health records are associated with your facial recognition records. Now imagine you have an allergy to certain medications and are involved in a car accident, or you have a heart attack. By scanning your face your medication allergies are known and you are administered the correct medication. Or imagine an elderly person with Alzheimer’s or other serious health issues and they wander off. Couldn’t this technology help find them and bring them to safety?</p>

<p>People are starting to use technology to track their activity on a daily basis – Nike’s Fuel Band, Fitbit, and Jawbone all make personal biometric data collection devices that are meant to be worn 24×7 and track your steps, your sleep patterns and even your heartbeat. What if you shared this data with your healthcare provider? You may get lower healthcare premiums if you live an active lifestyle. Or what if your heart starts beating irregularly in your sleep – what if medical help was summoned on your behalf?</p>

<p>Also imagine for a moment your healthcare provider is your government and they have facial recognition capability. What if you are spotted regularly eating at pizza places and fast food restaurants? Might you receive a call from your healthcare provider urging more healthy choices?</p>

<p>Is it just a coincidence that our National Institute for Health and our National Science Foundation just announced 15 million in new Big Data fundamental research?</p>

<p>“To get the most value from the massive biological data sets we are now able to collect, we need better ways of managing and analyzing the information they contain,” said NIH Director Francis S. Collins. “The new awards that NIH is funding will help address these technological challenges–and ultimately help accelerate research to improve health–by developing methods for extracting important, biomedically relevant information from large amounts of complex data.” 3</p>

<p><strong>Immigration:</strong> It is easy to add surveillance of airports, train stations and ports and your passport/travel documents already have your name and photo, plus radio frequency ID tags (RFID). Fingerprint records are captured from you upon entry.
“The U.S. Electronic Passport (e-passport) is the same as a regular passport with the addition of a small contactless integrated circuit (computer chip) embedded in the back cover. The chip securely stores the same data visually displayed on the photo page of the passport, and additionally includes a digital photograph. The inclusion of the digital photograph enables biometric comparison, through the use of facial recognition technology, at international borders. The U.S. e-passport also has a new look, incorporating additional anti-fraud and security features. Since August 2007, the U.S. has been issuing only e-passports.” 4</p>

<p>If we see a face it we don’t recognize (you are not in the citizen database and not in the visitor database) then who are you? Why are you here? Of course this assumes of course an extremely high success rate with facial recognition – all of the scenarios I am describing will only work if there is a very very low error rate.</p>

<h3 id="not-just-privacy-vs-security">Not just Privacy vs. Security</h3>

<p>In the end we all know there is a collision between privacy and security. Yet this is so much broader than many people realize. I do believe like all technology it has the power to make the world a better place when used responsibly.</p>

    <span class="post-date">Thu, Oct 11, 2012</span>

    <p><img class="lazy img-rounded img-responsive" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" alt="TEDx" data-src="/assets/img/TEDx-logo.jpg" width="750"></p>

<p>Yesterday I had the pleasure of mental stimulation.  The theme of the TEDx OC conference was relevance.  Specifically how do you stay relevant in today’s world?</p>

<p>As the day progressed this theme blossomed for me.   I took away a number of new ideas and perspectives.  I learned things from people whom I expected to learn things from but also from unexpected places, which quite frankly is the best kind of serendipity.

Rick Warren was the host in the late afternoon.  Rick Warren is the founder of Saddleback Church.  Today, it is an evangelical congregation averaging 22,000 weekly attendees, a 120-acre campus, and has more than 300 community ministries.  He is large in stature as well as personality, but as the host I wasn’t thinking of him in the same manner as a presenter – subtle way of saying I wasn’t expecting much.</p>

<p>It’s obvious in hindsight that Rick must know some things about growing and nurturing an organization.  When he spoke of relevance it was startlingly relevant!  I took away two really great points and I thought I’d share them here.  The first point is relevant to both you as a person, as well as organizations.  Rick’s quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“When the pace of change around you is faster than the pace of change
inside you, you become irrelevant.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The pace of change in the world is relentless and moving ever faster.  In order to stay relevant you need to move at the same pace or better.  If not, you fall behind.  If you are a cyclist then you aren’t in the peloton anymore.</p>

<p>Obvious and simple right?  But for me it’s highly relevant.  My organization is changing and we are trying to do it as fast as possible.  But at the same time we are trying to operate globally which adds coordination and slows decision making.  How does an organization both move “at speed” and “as one” globally?  This is a hard problem to solve.  Social media, modern communications tools and other things may help but how to really accelerate?</p>

<p>One idea I loved was the point Rick made to “develop a lab mentality”.  Never stop experimenting.  Fail fast and move on.  Now this is not new.  I’ve heard from many, many innovators that innovation happens slowly, over time, via experimentation, openness and curiosity.  The classic Thomas Edison story about the invention of the light bulb is how real innovation occurs.</p>

<p>Today, many companies (if not all) are trying to be more innovative.  But how?  There are many great examples in the wild.  For example in advertising you are starting to see “labs” emerge as a new nomenclature.  Olgivy and BBH have created labs and I’ll use BBH’s as an example.  Here is their mission and vision:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Labs is BBH’s global innovation unit. We’re tasked with pioneering
new outputs and approaches: exploring emerging platforms and behaviours
on behalf of brands, and developing new agency models along the way.
Our overall ambition is to find ways in which marketing innovation can
be a powerful force for good (more effective, more engaging, more
sustainable, more exciting).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The concept of adopting a lab mentality is in my view the only way for large organizations to become more innovative.  Why?</p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>dedicated lab</strong> is necessary. The reason they need to be dedicated is that in an environment where the pace of change is so fast, it’s hard for people to adequately deal with the <em>present</em>, while at the same time imagining and developing the future.</li>
<li>The people and skills required to invent the future are <strong>different</strong> from “line” jobs in the organization.</li>
</ul>

<p>The other key takeaway from Rick was his thoughts on grief.  Yes, grief.  Rick said something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Growth requires change</strong>.  You cannot simply continue to do what you have always done.  You are guaranteed to be irrelevant.</li>
<li><strong>Change causes loss</strong>.  Change requires letting go of the past.  It means ending old ways, old culture, old products, and even letting go of people who are no longer relevant to the organizations future.  This causes a deep sense of loss.</li>
<li><strong>Loss causes pain</strong>.  Letting go of the old and familiar in order the grab the new and different is hard.  It is scary.  It can be wrenching and painful and sad.</li>
<li><strong>Loss and pain cause grief</strong>.  You must respect and honor grief.  You must honor the past without perpetuating the past.  Many people who you think are oppositional to change are just grieving. You must allow people to grieve and you must help them through the grieving period.</li>
</ol>

<p>This gave me a whole new perspective on change and innovation.  I know I am not wired for empathy.  I struggle with grief.  I never know what to say.  I never know how to comfort someone who is grieving.  I simply feel awkward and uncomfortable and alone.  This means if I want to more effectively lead change I must also grow personally to able to honor someone’s grief.  I love the use of the word “honor” – because I know I can do it.  I can honor the grief someone feels when change is occurring.</p>

<p>So thanks Dr. Rick for giving me some needed perspective and adding to my serendipity at TEDx OC!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve collected bits of information about Apple that I have found interesting and/or inspiring from about the web and could never really muster a cohesive post from them.  But everytime I read them I felt inspired, starting with the title of this post. To me it sums up Apple in six words.</p>

<p>I decided to share my collection in raw form in the hopes they inspire you as well.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Insanely Great</strong></p>

<p>Market share and profitability are only outcomes. They are not Apple’s purpose; its mission is to achieve the &ldquo;insanely great&rdquo;.  It is as if they are on an ongoing Grail quest. (As Professor Henry Jones said to Indiana: &ldquo;The search for the Grail is the search for the Divine in all of us.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>As you probably know, there is a great deal of copy-catting in advertising and marketing. But here&rsquo;s the thing: when we present case studies of great marketing, we don&rsquo;t use Apple anymore because it is viewed as an outlier of such magnitude that many of us in the industry regard it as inimitable.</p>

<p>Our clients feel like there is nothing to learn from Apple because if you could deliver &#8211; with nearly every single product &#8211; an amazing user experience, genuine technical innovations, uncompromisingly stylish packaging AND be backed by a company who is unafraid to pursue a singular vision vs. what the focus groups say, then it&rsquo;d be EASY to do great marketing because all you&rsquo;d have to do is a great product demo.  Which, by the way, is exactly what most Apple product ads are.”</p>

<p><strong>Apple Usability</strong></p>

<p>I worked for Apple in New York City for a little over a year. Does the company want to push product? Yes. Does it want to make a profit? Of course.  BUT it also has created life-changing technologies, particularly for those with disabilities.</p>

<p>There are voice-over features for those with vision issues, notepads and video communication features for those with hearing disabilities. I remember selling an iPhone to a woman who was blind and teaching her how to use the voice-over features and it was extraordinary. She is now able to be a part of this new wave of communication and inter-connectedness. I also remember a group of deaf men looking to upgrade their iPhones as well. Their fingers were flying across the screen as they were using the Notepad app to communicate with me (as someone not fluent in ASL). For many people these aren&rsquo;t just frivolous technologies, they truly change the way people are able to connect within our able-centric society. They create simple linkages where before there was frustrations, disadvantages, and impossibilities.</p>

<p><strong>Apple Style</strong></p>

<p>This is certainly why my own conversion to Apple, and my deep loyalty to the company and its products, somehow felt comforting in the last decade. Their style elevates me, their power and reliability I have come to take for granted. Their stores have the innovation and beauty that a renewed Christianity would muster in its churches…</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>

<p>But if those translucent, airy, elegant stores do not evoke a secular kind of church, then I don&rsquo;t know what does.  &ldquo;Style&rdquo; is in some ways the most sublime and mysterious of product attributes.  And nothing beats Apple&rsquo;s style.</p>

<p><strong>Apple Accountability</strong></p>

<p>One lesson could be called the &ldquo;Difference between the Janitor and the Vice President,&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s a sermon Jobs delivers every time an executive reaches the VP level.  Jobs imagines his garbage regularly not being emptied in his office, and when he asks the janitor why, he gets an excuse: The locks have been changed, and the janitor doesn&rsquo;t have a key. This is an acceptable excuse coming from someone who empties trash bins for a living. The janitor gets to explain why something went wrong.  Senior people do not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you’re the janitor,&rdquo; Jobs has repeatedly told incoming VPs, &ldquo;reasons matter.&rdquo; He continues: &ldquo;Somewhere between the janitor and the CEO, reasons stop mattering.&rdquo; That &ldquo;Rubicon,&rdquo; he has said, &ldquo;is crossed when you become a VP.&rdquo; (Apple has about 70 vice presidents out of more than 25,000 non-retail-store employees.)</p>

<p>Jobs indoctrinates a culture of responsibility by hosting a series of weekly meetings that are the metronome that sets the beat for the entire company. On Mondays he meets with his executive management team to discuss results and strategy as well as to review nearly every important project in the company. On Wednesdays he holds a marketing and communications meeting. Simplicity breeds clarity, as Jobs himself explained in a 2008 interview with Fortune.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Every Monday we review the whole business,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We look at
every single product under development. I put out an agenda.
Eighty percent is the same as it was the last week, and we just
walk down it every single week. We don’t have a lot of process at
Apple, but that’s one of the few things we do just to all stay on
the same page.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The accountability mindset extends down the ranks. At Apple there is never any confusion as to who is responsible for what. Internal Applespeak even has a name for it, the &ldquo;DRI,&rdquo;&rdquo; or directly responsible individual.  Often the DRI&rsquo;s name will appear on an agenda for a meeting, so everybody knows who is responsible. &ldquo;Any effective meeting at Apple will have an action list,&rdquo; says a former employee. &ldquo;Next to each action item will be the DRI.&rdquo; A common phrase heard around Apple when someone is trying to learn the right contact on a project: &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the DRI on that?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Lashinsky, Adam (2011). Inside Apple &#8212; From Steve Jobs down to the janitor: How America&rsquo;s most successful &#8211; and most secretive &#8211; big company really works.</em></p>

        20.5 Million hits a day using an Amazon Micro server ($15 a month) and Node.js
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Mon, Apr 30, 2012</span>

    <p>I have been building a website recently just to get current with the latest web technologies and scaling.  I  saw this post on Hacker News: <a href="http://www.ewanleith.com/blog/900/10-million-hits-a-day-with-wordpress-using-a-15-server" title="10 Million hits a day with WordPress using a $15 server">10 Million hits a day with WordPress using a $15 server</a> and was intrigued.  It was time to benchmark one of my own applications (<a href="http://www.vizilinkz.com/" title="ViziLinkz">vizilinkz.com</a>) since it also runs on an Amazon Micro server for now as my development/production machine.
</p>

<p>First, let’s get this out of the way. Amazon will throttle your micro server into the ground if you actually ran this level of traffic for an extended period of time. This <a href="http://gregsramblings.com/2011/02/07/amazon-ec2-micro-instance-cpu-steal/">article </a>explains it rather well. However this experiment still illustrates what is possible with this level of virtual hardware. If you actually have high levels of traffic then you already know a micro instance is not for you.</p>

<p>I’m using an Amazon Linux x86 machine image (ami-31814f58) and the machine type is a “t1.micro” instance ($0.02 per hour – two cents an hour!). This is how Amazon describes a micro instance:</p>

<ul>
<li>613 MB memory</li>
<li>Up to 2 EC2 Compute Units (for short periodic bursts)</li>
<li>EBS storage only</li>
<li>32-bit or 64-bit platform</li>
<li>I/O Performance: Low</li>
<li>API name: t1.micro</li>
</ul>

<p>I am using a 32 bit instance. I installed MySQL and compiled Node.js and then installed my web application – that’s it. Took me about an hour because I also installed phpMyAdmin and I hadn’t done it in a while.</p>

<p>Some notes before we start testing – my Node.js application uses the Express framework and in the docs I noticed something interesting:</p>

<p>To alter the environment we can set the NODE_ENV environment variable, for example: <code>$ NODE_ENV=production node app.js</code></p>

<p>This is very important, as many caching mechanisms are only enabled when in production.</p>

<p>So I set environment to production and we are ready to start testing. Like the original WordPress post I am also using blitz.io and therefore had to do some housekeeping setting my application to serve their API key (clever since it prevents you from using blitz.io as a DoS tool). Once all that was done I was ready to run my first load test. I wasn’t really sure what to expect.</p>

<p><strong>Let’s run a blitz.io “rush” to see how we’re doing:</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.wanderingcio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/15-1.png"><img src="http://www.wanderingcio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/15-1-300x140.png" alt="Hit Rate" title="15-1" /></a></p>

<p><em>(click the image to see a full size version)</em></p>

<p>Note that blitz.io ramps up from 0 to 250 users, and our peak response rate was 238 hits per second as you can see above. This peak rate translates into <strong>20,563,200 hits per day</strong>!</p>

<p>Throughout the test our response rates looked pretty stable and averaged 13ms for the duration of the test:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wanderingcio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/15-2.png"><img src="http://www.wanderingcio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/15-2-300x139.png" alt="Response Times" title="15-2" /></a></p>

<p><em>(click the image to see a full size version)</em></p>

<p>Interestingly blitz.io calculates your <em>average</em> hit rate during the test and uses that to estimate hits per day rather than your peak rate. I’m not sure why they do it that way. Here is their summary:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wanderingcio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/15-3.png"><img src="http://www.wanderingcio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/15-3-300x44.png" alt="Summary" title="15-3" /></a></p>

<p><em>(click the image to see a full size version)</em></p>

<p>So what did we learn here? That Node.js on an Amazon micro instance can run really well?  Well yes I suppose, and this bodes well for true scalability to larger machines and to machine clusters in the future. But the real meat here is the confluence of several trends: ever more efficient web delivery (Nginx, Node.js, Varnish, etc.) , the move away from serving pages to serving data, and finally cloud infrastructure, means it is exceptionally easy to build highly scalable web sites for a very very small investment compared to several years ago.</p>

<p>This has profound implications for &ldquo;corporate IT&rdquo;!</p>

<p><a href="http://bconnected-project.berkeley.edu/about/email-calendar-platform-comparison">UC Berkeley just did a great assessment of Office 365 vs. Google Apps</a>.  What I really like is how they were able to make the results easy to understand for their constituency.</p>

<p>I often struggle to communicate large, impactful descisions across a large organization.  They did a great job with the &ldquo;Assessment Matrix&rdquo; matrix they created that clearly spells out each function by priority, and which platform &ldquo;wins&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In this case I think transparency wins.  Good example to learn from!</p>

        The Corporate iCloud, part 2

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Thu, Dec 22, 2011</span>

    <p>When Apple introduced iCloud I wrote an article about the potential impact in the corporate computing space: <a href="http://danstroot.com/2011/06/10/corporate-icloud/">The Corporate iCloud</a>.</p>

<p>In the article I compared what I was doing with Dropbox as a potential corporate version of iCloud.  It turns out there was a LOT more there than meets the eye.  Dropbox may even have <strong>become</strong> iCloud had some things gone a bit differently.</p>

<p>Wired has done a <a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/12/backdrop-dropbox">deep dive</a> on this topic.  It&rsquo;s a great read.</p>

      <p>Apple’s announcements at this year’s WWDC keynote will have far reaching effects.  Much has already been written about the impacts to you and me as consumers of Apple products.  But let’s stop and think for a moment about how this will affect our perceptions about technology, and how that will translate into the corporate IT space.</p>
  </div>
</div>
</p>

<h3 id="apple-s-vision">Apple’s Vision</h3>

<p>With Google, the company perhaps most associated with the cloud, the approach starts with a common business scenario and then applies it to the “cloud”.  They’re extending familiar concepts. Google Docs is Microsoft Office, but in the cloud. Gmail is Outlook, but in the cloud.</p>

<p>Google seems to be aiming for users who understand current computing paradigms and are able to apply that knowledge to “the cloud”. Power users, if you will. Many of the people reading this post are in this camp.</p>

<p>Corporate IT is in this camp, and feels very comfortable with the Google approach because it’s a like-for-like comparison.  It simply becomes a discussion of cost, features, and security.   In the case of Google corporate IT has a few “silver bullets” because Google’s vision is so cloud focused.  So far Google’s vision is that everything is always there because everything only exists in the cloud.  So what happens when you are in an airplane with no internet access (flying through the real clouds with no metaphorical cloud access)?</p>

<p>Apple’s approach to the concept of the cloud is the opposite of Google’s.  As you know, at Apple conferences focus is on the demos so here’s the iCloud demo: You’re working on a document in Pages on your iPad, you move over to Pages on your Mac, and there it is. It even remembers where you were last editing. You download a song to your iPhone, you pick up your iPad, and there it is. With iPad/iPhone and now OS X Lion, you don’t even save documents anymore. They save automatically.  Apple’s view is consumers have absolutely no idea what the cloud is, don’t care, and shouldn’t care.</p>

<p>Apple’s vision is all your “stuff” just exists, in real-time, on all your devices.</p>

<p>Apple view is the cloud to a place that only exists in the background.  You never interact with it, your apps do — and you never even realize it.  It’s magic. “It all just works.”  “Automatically” - Steve Jobs kept saying this over and over again on stage. When Steve does this, it’s never an accident. It’s a message.</p>

<p>Apple has been going out of their way to avoid using the word “syncing” with regard to iCloud. That implies that files exist in one place and need to be moved and/or copied.  That’s way too technical for the story Apple is weaving.  Files are something Microsoft worries about. Files in the cloud are something Google worries about.</p>

<p>Apple’s iCloud is about picking up any (Apple) device you happen to have, opening any (Apple) application you want and voila! The thing you want to access being right there, right where you left off.  “It all just works”.  “Automatically”.</p>

<h3 id="the-impact-of-apple-s-vision-on-corporate-it">The Impact of Apple’s Vision on Corporate IT</h3>

<p>Most people I know use email as the “poor man’s” iCloud.  When working on a document they send it to themselves in email.  Using email, they can usually access the document on their home computer, iPad, iPhone or other device, and hopefully continue editing it.  Then when done, save it again and email it back to themselves.  Thus ensuring corporate email is hopelessly bloated, and also ensuring corporate security is hopelessly paranoid about what is contained in everyone’s inbox.</p>

<p>I have found a slightly better way using DropBox (there is also Box.com) as the corporate “poor man’s” iCloud.  I have DropBox loaded on my work provided Laptop, my home PC, my iPad and my iPhone.  When I am actively working on a document I place it in my DropBox folder and DropBox takes care of syncing it to all my devices “automatically”.</p>

<p>In theory I can just open it up on the device I happen to be using at the time and continue editing.  But not all editors on all devices are equal, and I have to remember to save the file myself, and when I open the file on another device it does not know where I last was in the document.  But, it is still a huge step forward from the email approach.</p>

<p>But what happens when my corporate clients start using iCloud on their Apple devices?  Their perceptions and expectations will be forever changed.  Their view of the current corporate IT approach is that we are already far behind the “consumerization” trends.  What will our response be?</p>

<p>Some companies are going the opposite direction – lock everything down and don’t let any data ever leave the corporate data center.  We all know how this ends – you can never put the genie back in the bottle.</p>

<p>I think there is a huge opportunity for DropBox, or a company like DropBox, to help us extend corporate IT out in a secure way and bridge the Apple and non-Apple worlds.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

        iPad Security Vulnerability: Fingerprints
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Wed, Apr 28, 2010</span>

    <p>I have noticed a security vulnerability on the iPad – fingerprints!  Each time I use my iPad I have to type in my four digit security code.  This leaves four fingerprints telling you very clearly what four digits I use.</p>

<p>Now you only have to guess the order, and there are only 16 possible combinations.  Unless I wipe the screen each time this makes it really easy to hack my iPad if it was lost or stolen.  I think it&rsquo;s time for a longer passcode.</p>

<p>Update: I also added a matte screen saver and this helps quite a bit.</p>

        iPad Goes Corporate
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Fri, Jan 29, 2010</span>

    <p>Like many people in the Technology world I watched Apple&rsquo;s iPad announcement this week with intense interest.  Unlike most people I am interested not in the consumer space  - but rather how could this device be used for business.  How could a new category like this be used?
</p>

<h3 id="opportunities-for-the-ipad-in-financial-services">Opportunities for the iPad in financial services:</h3>

<p>Those who stand to benefit the most from the iPad are financial advisers who are constantly meeting clients on the go, says Doug Dannemiller, senior analyst at Aite Group.</p>

<p>For advisers, <strong>data visualization and presentation</strong> are key. And one of the most interesting aspects of the iPad is its zoom and flip page capabilities, which means it can be shared with a client more easily than a laptop, Dannemiller points out.</p>

<p>“I see the laptop as not a good collaborative tool,” he explains. A laptop computer acts as a barrier between the adviser and client, since it is only one person (presumably the adviser) who will handle the keyboard, hit the return key and flip the computer round to face the client.</p>

<p>On the other hand, with an iPad, you can reach over and touch the screen, instead of having to navigate with a button or a mouse.
“With the iPad, an adviser could navigate better, sweep pages across, look at a client’s financial plan and statements, and work more collaboratively side by side. It’s a subtle difference. The touch-screen means you can sit on the same side of the table, work as a partner,” Dannemiller adds.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen apps for the iPhone , such as the Bloomberg app, which are quite strong, where you can drill in to pie charts to see the next layer of detail,” he says. “I can see these apps being used on the iPad, where people can navigate personal financial information.”</p>

<p>The iPad’s media integration capabilities make it particularly attractive for financial advisers, adds Todd Christy, president and CTO, Pyxis Mobile.</p>

<p>The device’s rich text, enhanced reader application, combined with a large bright screen and embedded video, make it a great tool for presentations, Christy points out.</p>

<p>“For us, we would expect to be consuming content from Thomson Reuters and embedding it in a business context. We would have clients holdings, a chart of asset allocation, and a chief equity analyst speaking about positions relevant to the client’s portfolio. Technically you can do that on the iPhone, but sharing the information [on the iPad] with the client in a personal way across a couch or table, hasn’t really existed before.</p>

<h3 id="apple-s-plans">Apple&rsquo;s plans:</h3>

<p>Clearly iWork is a nod to users who need to get work done using an iPad. Pages, Numbers, and Keynote cover word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation tasks. The iPad can also be attached to a projector to give a presentation directly from the device. You can still import and export files compatible with Microsoft&rsquo;s Word, Excel, and Powerpoint, just like you can with the desktop versions. Conceivably Microsoft could develop iPad versions of Office apps if it determines that the demand was there.</p>

<p>By using the iPhone OS as a starting point the iPad gains the enterprise features of iPhone OS, including Exchange ActiveSync support for e-mail, contacts, and calendars. But according to AppleInsider&rsquo;s sources, Apple has some enterprise-friendly features planned for the iPad that haven&rsquo;t yet been publicly announced. One feature is a planned ability to access standard file servers on a local network. The other is the ability to print to networked printers. Combined with Office-compatible iWork apps, an iPad could be useful for many routine business tasks.</p>

<h3 id="considerations">Considerations:</h3>

<h4 id="pros">Pros</h4>

<ul>
<li>Marketing/Branding/Image – nothing will say “leading edge” like pulling out an iPad.  We all know there is power in brand association and Apple is a very powerful brand.</li>
<li>Built-in 3G wireless – makes the device compelling compared to a netbook with additional wireless card/modem.
Lower support costs: Apple’s “walled garden” for apps means the devices stay stable and fast.</li>
<li>Lower training costs: we all know Apple&rsquo;s devices require little to no end-user training and Apple provides &ldquo;how to&rdquo; videos via Apple academy that could be loaded on to the device</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="cons">Cons</h4>

<ul>
<li>Security – this is a big issue and a potential show stopper.  Since the device runs a version of the iPhone OS I assume it can be connected to our email system (Exchange) and we can remote wipe the machine if it is lost (assuming it remains connected to a network).  However alternative messaging paths cannot be controlled, loading apps cannot be controlled so other messaging and social medial (gmail, facebook, etc.) will be wide open.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="unknowns">Unknowns:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Size:  Is a 9.7” screen large enough?  If one of our externals is consuming content from Apollo on the screen does it really work?  Most indications are that content providers are redesigning their content specifically for that screen.</li>
<li>Durability: How well would the device stand up to the rigors of travel?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="summary">Summary:</h3>

<p>This is a very real possibility for the externals in lieu of a netbook.</p>

<p>Corporate Requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>The ability to create a corporate whitelist or blacklist of apps that employees are allowed to use, either specific apps or categories of apps</li>
<li>Connect to corporate email</li>
<li>Policy enforcement: password ( even better would some type of sync where I use my corporate password )</li>
<li>Remote wipe</li>
<li>Encryption</li>
<li>Can work without having to ever connect to a desktop.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-trojan-horse-approach">The trojan horse approach:</h3>

<p>How about using the iPad as a &ldquo;thin client&rdquo; (pun intended!) and running a full install of Windows 7 on the iPad?  It turns out the 9.7 inch display on the iPad with a 1024x768 screen resolution works great for a full VDI XenDesktop (Citrix). Windows desktops and applications run unmodified and securely in the data center. The advancements that were made for the Citrix Receiver for iPhone will carry over to the iPad, however the iPhone restrictions of screen size and small keyboard are overcome with the iPad.</p>

<p>What you are seeing in the picture is Windows 7 running on the iPad SDK simulator, thanks to Citrix Receiver and XenDesktop 4—running meaning that it&rsquo;s executed on a server and remotely displayed on the iPad at full resolution.The iPad looks like it might work as and end point device where corporate IT will be able to safely deliver company hosted virtual desktops and apps without worry.  How cool would that be?</p>

        Lessons from Haiti - Never Under Estimate Ease of Use
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Fri, Jan 15, 2010</span>

    <p><img class="lazy img-rounded img-responsive" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" alt="Haiti" data-src="/assets/img/haiti.jpg"></p>

<p>My assistant Kathy told me today about donating to Haitian relief efforts by simply sending a text message from my cellphone.  The Red Cross, via a company called mGive, has got the major U.S. carriers on board to allow people to very easily donate $10 to the Red Cross via a simple SMS text message.</p>

<p>This led to an &ldquo;unprecedented mobile response,&rdquo; and has raised over $10 million in relief for Haiti.  With text donations peaking at a rate of 10,000 a minute, at $10 per donation, this is raising $100,000 per minute!</p>

<p>I had been watching the news about Haiti and was heartbroken at what they are going through.  I wanted to help.  But did I?

<strong>Wanting to donate</strong> and <strong>actually donating</strong> are two different things.  Deciding the amount, finding my checkbook, writing a check, finding an envelope and stamp, addressing the envelope, mailing it – well frankly it was exhausting just typing all those steps.  Not only that but it&rsquo;s hard to imagine finding 10 minutes in my day to actually do it!  This new process cut that time down to less than 30 seconds!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you want to donate simply text HAITI to the number
90999. A $10 charge will be added to your next cellphone bill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the reasons text messaging is so popular is because it’s so simple. Anyone with just about any kind of mobile device can do it. And that’s precisely why it is ingenious to use this mechanism for donations.</p>

<p>By making things easy for people we overcome our natural human “inertia”.  This is exactly why I love shopping at Amazon.com.  Because of  their patented “one-click” ordering and Amazon Prime, which basically gets you products super-fast without worrying about shipping, I buy everything from Amazon, with rare exception – even when they are NOT the best price. Why?  I like shopping with them.  The experience is flawless, and few things in life are flawless.</p>

<p>Of course another great company comes immediately to mind - want to venture a guess? Apple Computer.  I&rsquo;m a corporate technology person yet in our four person household we have 4 iPhones, several iPods, and three Mac Computers.   Why?  Mainly because it is much easier for their helpdesk (Me).  They can figure it out on their own!  One could make a strong argument that Apple “won” the MP3 player wars with two weapons – the iPod and its incredible user interface, and iTunes which made getting music on your device simple.  I consider it a hallmark of modern technology when we can create human interfaces that are so intuitive, like an iPod Touch, that a three year old could use it.</p>

<p>There are huge opportunities here for corporate IT.  Just a couple examples to get your creative juices flowing:</p>

<p>Making things easier for our clients:</p>

<ul>
<li>How about “one-click” investing?</li>
<li>Your account “Tweets” when the balance is low?</li>
</ul>

<p>Making things easier for our employees:</p>

<ul>
<li>How about sending a text message to get your password reset?</li>
<li>How about implementing UI’s on corporate systems that are as well designed and easy to learn as an iPod?</li>
</ul>

<p>None of this is easy - but &ldquo;ease of use&rdquo; always wins in the end!</p>

<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>

<p>However you know me, or however you found me, I’m glad you are here.</p>

<p>I have been a Chief Information Officer for a long time and it&rsquo;s clear that “managing information” is just the price of entry. In today&rsquo;s world I think CIO must mean “Chief Innovation Officer”. Managing innovation buys you a seat at the head table.</p>

<p>My ambition is to find ways in which technology and innovation can be leveraged for more effective, more engaging, more sustainable, and more exciting business growth.</p>

<p>Some examples I am interested are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Harnessing the consumerization of enterprise technology</li>
<li>Encouraging data “curation” and ownership in a large, diverse corporate enterprise</li>
<li>The social enterprise, ideas and how they propagate and mass collaboration</li>
<li>Social brand development, social capital and online reputation</li>
<li>Frictionless security - i.e. security that will not be actively resisted by employees</li>
<li>Development approaches that are rapid, iterative &amp; nimble</li>
<li>Open source, transparent, collaborative, “hive” development</li>
<li>Scale computing in all forms, shapes and sizes (Cloud, Software as a Service, Platform as a service, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve been happily married to Julie for over twenty-two years, and have I have two children, Matt and Elise, who make me very proud. Julie and I met at UCLA where she was in Pi Beta Phi and I was in Lambda Chi Alpha. Go Bruins!</p>

<p>My favorites movies are Princess Bride and Dead Poets Society. I actually have &ldquo;Carpe Diem&rdquo; imprinted on my custom iPad cover!</p>

<p>I love driving/riding anything with a motor and enjoy both dirt and street motorcycing and yes I probably go too fast. I generally love anything outdoors. Seems I have really gotten into hiking lately. I appreciate a good 10-15 mile summit hike and have hit most of the local southern California peaks. It&rsquo;s good to get your heart rate up for 4-8 hours!</p>

<p>My favorite place on earth is Hawaii, so a big mahalo to all of you who feel the same way. There is no place else where I can literally step off the plane and feel the weight lift from my shoulders and my spirit open up.</p>

<h2 id="technical-details-about-this-site">Technical Details About This Site</h2>

<p>We are all standing on the back of giants and I am constantly amazed at the quality and diversity of tools available. I love learning and using new technology, and I am a generally curious person, so I am always interested in what technologies others use to create sites - so I thought I might share what tools I am using.</p>

<p>While this site is very simple in some ways in others it serves as my classroom and testbed. It is basically a static site built using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and hosted on Amazon <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">S3/CloudFront</a>. Since I am using the Cloudfront CDN I have good delivery performance globally.</p>

<p>Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through Markdown and Liquid converters, and creates a complete, ready-to-publish static website. This simplicity keeps it very reliable and also very secure. This is a great lesson for corporate sites - the simpler the architecture the easier it is to secure and operate.</p>

<p>Here is a quick list of what I am currrently using:</p>

<ul>
<li>Source code and content is managed on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a></li>
<li>Continuous integration testing is performed by <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis</a></li>
<li>Site is published via <a href="https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website">S3_website</a></li>
