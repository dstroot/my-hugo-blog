Sometimes there are branches and special cases to keep track of as you go. Procedures/checklists are frustrating because they’re focus-intensive yet require very little thought. They demand our full attention, but our attention isn’t rewarded with interesting problems or satisfying solutions – just another checkbox checked. Procedures like this are called a <strong>slog</strong>.<p>Slogs are ripe for automation. We know that a computer could do it better than we can, and with less tendency toward practical drift. However, automating slogs feels like an all-or-nothing proposition. Maybe we could write a script to handle step 2, or step 5, but that wouldn’t really make the procedure any less cumbersome. It would lead to a proliferation of single-purpose scripts with different conventions and expectations, and you’d still have to follow a documented multi-step procedure for using those scripts.<p>This <strong>perception of futility</strong> is the problem we really need to solve in order to escape from these manual slogs. Here&rsquo;s an approach that works. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;executable documentation&rdquo;.<p>Almost any slog can be turned into executable documentation. Executable documentation is a script that encodes the instructions of a slog, encapsulating each step in a function. For example we could write the following executable documentation script:<pre><code class="language-sh">#! /bin/sh

These scripts will have little logic, and make little use of variables. They can also have a .txt filename to ensure that people understand, that first of all, this is a set of instructions for how to do something, which also just so happens to be a valid shell script.<p>At first glance, it might not be obvious that this script provides any value, but the value is immense. First, these scripts actually do something: they allow storing and updating the <em>state</em> of a process. By having these scripts run in a shell rather than in your head, the current state is stored in a machine, not your brain.</p><a class="" href="https://danstroot.com/2019/08/07/executable-documentation/">Read On <span class="icon-chevron-circle-right"></span></a></div><hr class="soften"></div><div class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://danstroot.com/2019/03/02/digital-business-card/">Digital Business Card</a></h1><span class="post-date">March 2, 2019 &middot; <span class="icon-clock-o"></span> 4 minute read &middot; <a href="https://danstroot.com/2019/03/02/digital-business-card/#disqus_thread">Comments</a><br></span><div class="post-content"><p><img src="https://danstroot.com/img/shredded.jpg" alt="shredded paper"><p>Recently I took on a new role.

Kapur<br><small>Computerworld | JUN 21, 2004 7:00 AM PT</small><p>Early in my career, when I worked as an engineer, my boss had a process by which the engineering team was expected to report project status. He insisted that we use the following steps, in the specified order:<ol><li><strong>Punch line:</strong> The facts; no adjectives, adverbs or modifiers. &ldquo;Milestone 4 wasn&rsquo;t hit on time, and we didn&rsquo;t start Task 8 as planned.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;Received charter approval as planned.&rdquo;<li><strong>Current status:</strong> How the punch-line statement affects the project. &ldquo;Because of the missed milestone, the critical path has been delayed five days.&rdquo;<li><strong>Next steps:</strong> The solution, if any. &ldquo;I will be able to make up three days during the next two weeks but will still be behind by two days.&rdquo;<li><strong>Explanation:</strong> The reason behind the punch line. &ldquo;Two of the five days&rsquo; delay is due to late discovery of a hardware interface problem, and the remaining three days&rsquo; delay is due to being called to help the customer support staff for a production problem.&rdquo;</ol><p>Notice the almost reverse order of these points in comparison with the common reporting style in which team members start with a long explanation of why things went wrong. Using the four steps described above, the project manager learns the most important information first, then he learns supporting information to help complete the story.</p><a class="" href="https://danstroot.com/2019/02/08/im-ok-the-bull-is-dead./">Read On <span class="icon-chevron-circle-right"></span></a></div><hr class="soften"></div><div class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://danstroot.com/2019/01/06/the-polygon-of-enterprise-despair/">The Polygon of Enterprise Despair</a></h1><span class="post-date">January 6, 2019 &middot; <span class="icon-clock-o"></span> 25 minute read &middot; <a href="https://danstroot.com/2019/01/06/the-polygon-of-enterprise-despair/#disqus_thread">Comments</a><br></span><div class="post-content"><p><img src="https://danstroot.com/img/polygon.png" alt="The polygon of enterprise despair"><p>When enterprises see the changes wrought by disruptors in music (Spotify), advertising (Google) or retail (Amazon), they wonder what may be in store for them.<p>As of this writing, in early 2019 Sears announced it is near liquidation, with a $4.4B bid to keep operating.
