In today&rsquo;s world I think CIO must mean “Chief Innovation Officer”. Managing innovation buys you a seat at the head table.<p>My ambition is to find ways in which technology and innovation can be leveraged for more effective, more engaging, more sustainable, and more exciting business growth.<p>Some examples I am interested are:<ul><li>Harnessing the consumerization of enterprise technology<li>Encouraging data “curation” and ownership in a large, diverse corporate enterprise<li>The social enterprise, ideas and how they propagate and mass collaboration<li>Social brand development, social capital and online reputation<li>Frictionless security - i.e. security that will not be actively resisted by employees<li>Development approaches that are rapid, iterative &amp; nimble<li>Open source, transparent, collaborative, “hive” development<li>Scale computing in all forms, shapes and sizes (Cloud, Software as a Service, Platform as a service, etc.)</ul><h2 id="where-i-ve-worked">Where I&rsquo;ve Worked</h2><ul><li><a href="http://www.accenture.com/us-en/pages/index.aspx">Associate Partner: Accenture</a><li><a href="http://us.allianzgi.com/Pages/Default.aspx">Global CIO: Allianz Global Investors</a></ul><h2 id="education">Education</h2><ul><li>University of California at Los Angeles, BA Economics, 1985<ul><li>Magna Cum Laude<li>Phi Beta Kappa</ul></ul><h2 id="community-service">Community Service</h2><ul><li>Board Member, Ronald McDonald House, Los Angeles<li>Technology Committee Member, Santa Margarita Catholic High School</ul><h2 id="open-source-contributions">Open Source Contributions</h2><h2 id="a-little-more-on-me-the-personal-side">A Little More on Me - the Personal Side</h2><p>I’ve been happily married to Julie for over twenty-two years, and have I have two children, Matt and Elise, who make me very proud. Julie and I met at UCLA where she was in Pi Beta Phi and I was in Lambda Chi Alpha. Go Bruins!<p>My favorites movies are Princess Bride and Dead Poets Society. I actually have &ldquo;Carpe Diem&rdquo; imprinted on my custom iPad cover!<p>I love driving/riding anything with a motor and enjoy both dirt and street motorcycing and yes I probably go too fast. I generally love anything outdoors. Seems I have really gotten into hiking lately. I appreciate a good 10-15 mile summit hike and have hit most of the local southern California peaks. It&rsquo;s good to get your heart rate up for 4-8 hours!<p>My favorite place on earth is Hawaii, so a big mahalo to all of you who feel the same way. There is no place else where I can literally step off the plane and feel the weight lift from my shoulders and my spirit open up.<h2 id="technical-details-about-this-site">Technical Details About This Site</h2><p>We are all standing on the back of giants and I am constantly amazed at the quality and diversity of tools available. I love learning and using new technology, and I am a generally curious person, so I am always interested in what technologies others use to create sites - so I thought I might share what tools I am using.<p>While this site is very simple in some ways in others it serves as my classroom and testbed. It is basically a static site built using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and hosted on Amazon <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">S3/CloudFront</a>. Since I am using the Cloudfront CDN I have good delivery performance globally.<p>Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through Markdown and Liquid converters, and creates a complete, ready-to-publish static website. This simplicity keeps it very reliable and also very secure. This is a great lesson for corporate sites - the simpler the architecture the easier it is to secure and operate.<p>Here is a quick list of what I am currrently using:<ul><li>Source code and content is managed on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a><li>Continuous integration testing is performed by <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis</a><li>Site is published via <a href="https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website">S3_website</a><li>Dependencies are watched by <a href="https://david-dm.org">David</a><li>Site performance and uptime is monitored using Rew Relic/Pingdom as well as AWS tools<li>Site analytics are provided by <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a><li>My personal images are served from <a href="http://en.gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a><li>Blog images are served directly from <a href="https://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a><li>The UI framework is <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a><li>The build system is <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a><li>The CSS is compiled from <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a><li>Site comments are provided by <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a><li>Site mailing list is managed via <a href="http://mailchimp.com/">Mailchimp</a></ul></div></div>
