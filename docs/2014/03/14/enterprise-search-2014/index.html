<p>One of the challenges in a large distributed enterprise is &ldquo;finding stuff&rdquo;.  Sure we call it collaboration, knowledge management, or any number of other sophisticated terms but often it boils down to just finding stuff.</p>

<p>To compensate the organization reacts by saving multiple copies and versions of a file in many different locations: email, shared file systems, intranets, etc.  Of course this compounds the issue and drives the desire to save &ldquo;my copy&rdquo; to &ldquo;somewhere where I can find it&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>A CIO&rsquo;s role is to figure out how to make this problem go away.  So we start with good solid information management concepts:</p>

<ul>
<li>We need a taxonomy of our information</li>
<li>We need to understand our &ldquo;golden copies&rdquo;, or master repositories</li>
<li>We need the information to be very easily searched and discovered by our employees - wherever they are. This problem encompasses:

<ul>
<li>Time zones</li>
<li>Languages</li>
<li>Geography and the associated latency</li>
<li>Indexing/crawling many diverse data stores</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It needs to be so simple and easy that it naturally overcomes the employee&rsquo;s desire save a personal copy.</li>
<li>We must have mature data access and permissioning processes in place.  Unleashing search on corporate systems where permissions aren&rsquo;t managed well is a huge risk.</li>
</ul>

<p>But even though these concepts are straightforward  they are not easy.  Many of us wished we could just &ldquo;Google&rdquo; our companies documents.  Google understands this and has made enterprise search a product for some time now - it was first released in 2002!  I was just taking a look at it recently and it has come a long way from where it started. Relevancy is the key however, and Google considers its relevancy calculation models to be a precious competitive differentiator and therefore keeps them opaque.</p>

<p>Many of us have tried to use Microsoft&rsquo;s platform in the past but it was always a bit of a challenge to manage, and the results were a hodgepodge.  It has also come a very long way with Microsoft&rsquo;s FAST search technology and in SharePoint 2013 there is a mature approach to deploying search.  This clarifies what had long been a confusing product line featuring many different kinds of search capability for SharePoint.</p>

<p>It is encouraging to see the progress and competition in this space. Someday soon corporate document/information search may be as simple as we are accustomed to on the web.</p>
