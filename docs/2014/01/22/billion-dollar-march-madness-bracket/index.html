<p>Quicken Loans and Warren Buffet annouced a billion dollar prize for a perfect NCAA college bracket prediction. As Quicken Loans puts it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You read that right: one billion. Not one million. Not one hundred million. Not five hundred million. One billion U.S. dollars.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="why-give-away-a-billion-dollars">Why Give Away a Billion Dollars?</h2>

<p>My first reaction when I heard this is &ldquo;where is the value?&rdquo;.  Companies award prizes all time and we know the reason this occurs is basic economics - which teaches us that the &ldquo;cost&rdquo; of the prize is less than the &ldquo;value&rdquo; the company derives from offering the prize.  So what amount marketing, exposure or publicity is worth <strong>one billion dollars?</strong>

The details of the prize are actually $25 million dollars for 40 years. So we can reframe the question as &ldquo;What amount of addional loan volume must Quicken Loans generate to produce more than $25 million of additional profit annually?&rdquo;  To get there we need to know the average revenue per loan and Quicken&rsquo;s profit margin.  For example if we assume $1,500 revenue per loan and a $10% profit margin this means Quicken Loans would earn a profit of $150 per loan.  So $25,000,000 / $150 = 166,667 loans (rounding up).</p>

<h2 id="this-all-may-be-moot">This All May be Moot</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s virtually impossible to predict a perfect bracket.  The math is simple: there are sixty-three games so it&rsquo;s 2 to the sixty-third power.  The odds of you filling out a perfect bracket are a staggering 1 in 9.2 quintillion.</p>

<h4 id="how-big-is-that">How big is that?</h4>

<ul>
<li>That&rsquo;s one billion, 9.2 billion times.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s 500,000 times more than our $17 trillion national debt.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="but-i-m-a-brackets-wizard">But I&rsquo;m a Brackets Wizard!</h4>

<p>If you are really smart and know that No. 1 seeds always advance in the first round, or tournament champions usually have a top-four seed, or about Duke&rsquo;s dual advantage of having a legend like Coach K and never getting called for a blocking foul you may be able to cut the odds down to something more like 1 in 128 billion.</p>

<p>Get schooled by DePaul math professor Jay Bergen:</p>

<p><iframe width="750" height="422" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/O6Smkv11Mj4" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Using 1 in 128 billion odds, if everyone in the United States filled out a bracket, we&rsquo;d see a perfect one <strong>every 400 years</strong>!  ESPN which has run a tournament challenge for the past 16 years has <strong>never had a perfect bracket in over 30 million entries</strong> according to the network.  I assume that many of the people filling those out are pretty smart.</p>

<h2 id="true-genius">True Genius!</h2>

<p>So the true genius of this is the prize will almost certainly not be awarded thus the marketing, exposure and publicity is free!  I initially puzzled over why Warren Buffet was involved but as a long time insurance executive he must have some sense of the actuarial odds on this. Brilliant!</p>
